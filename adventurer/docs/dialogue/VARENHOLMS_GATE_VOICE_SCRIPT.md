# Varenholm's Gate — Voice Script

The story campaign in playing order: every scene, caption, spoken line and pick-a-line choice, quest by quest. The player is silent — their picked lines are shown on screen and never recorded. Bracketed tags are ElevenLabs v3 delivery cues and stay in the text sent to the API. Names are never spoken: the game shows the name; the recorded "spoken" form drops {target}. Conditions in _italics_ say when a line plays; most scenes have alternatives depending on who is riding along and what the player chose earlier.

Part 2 is the casting appendix: one section per character with who they are, where they are from, how they speak (region and accent notes for picking a voice), and every clip in one place. Fill in the **Voice ID** for each character in `tools/voice_casting.json` (key = character id). Clips land at `audio/vo/campaign/<id>/<beat>_<n>.mp3`; `tools/c3_voice_lines.json` lists every clip to generate.

## The regions and their voices

Every named person comes from somewhere, and the somewhere is written into how they talk — word choice, rhythm and idiom, never phonetic spelling. Use these when casting.

| Region | Real-world flavour | Names | How they speak |
|---|---|---|---|
| Lanternhold and the hill keeps | Ethiopian highlands | Amharic (Tesfaye, Hiwot, Dawit, Abba Gebre, Yohannes) | Formal, unhurried, proverb-rich. Blessings and "my child". Sentences finish; nothing is clipped. Anger comes out quieter, not louder. |
| Thornbury, the Shore Road and the Wardens' country | Georgia, USA | Southern American (Beau, Delphine, Cal Boone, Lurleen, Merle) | Warm drawl. "I reckon", "I'll tell you what", "y'all", "fixing to", "bless him". Plain-spoken courtesy; ma'am and sir to strangers. Long vowels, short tempers. |
| Dunmere and the dwarf clans | Welsh valleys | Welsh (Gethin Pryce, Dai Morgan) | Sing-song cadence, sentences that end where they started ("I'll go down, I will"). "Bach", "now then", "there's lovely", "duw". Understatement about danger. |
| The Mirkhollow and the Umbra circle | Kenyan | Kikuyu and Swahili (Wanjiru, Mzee Kamau) | Direct and rhythmic. "Sawa", "pole pole", "eh?" at the end of a challenge, "Mzee" for elders. Swahili proverbs in translation ("haste has no blessing"). |
| Varenholm's Gate — dukes, Gauntlet, Consortium, temples, thieves | Nigerian (Yoruba and Igbo) | Yoruba / Igbo (Adebayo, Olumide, Folasade, Emeka, Kolade, Folake, Tunde) | Grand, formal city English. "It is not a small matter", "my friend", "ah-ah!", "I am telling you", "o" softening the end of a line. Titles matter; elders are "Baba" and "Mama". |
| The elves of the eastern woods | Japanese | Japanese (Itsuki, Kaito) | Understated and exact. Apology before request, gratitude after. Few words; the pause carries the feeling. "-san" for strangers of standing; never contractions when serious. |
| The deep cities of the dark elves | Arabic | Arabic (Layla) | Elevated, poetic, unhurried contempt. "By the deep", "ya" before a name, "God willing" said without belief. Images from stone, night and water. |
| Kalden, the witch-country beyond the steppe | Turkish | Turkish (Bahadır, Yasemin, the hamster Fındık) | Warm and emphatic. "Abla" / "abi" for elder sister and brother, "canım" for the beloved, "vallahi" as an oath, "inşallah" for hope. Hospitality as a rule of war. |
| Vashk and its Crimson Wizards | Indian | Sanskrit-derived (Devendra) | Ornate, formal, self-satisfied. "Kindly", "most assuredly", "it is quite evident". Compliments that are insults; never raises his voice. |
| The Umbral Hand | Jamaican | Caribbean (Desmond, Winston) | Light patois rhythm through word order and idiom, not spelling: "man", "you see it?", "no worry yourself", "one-one coco full basket". Dry warmth from Winston; sing-song from Desmond. |
| The Order of the Dawning Flame (chapter house in the sun-lands) | Mexican | Spanish (Santiago) | Courtly and earnest. "Señor", "señora", "with respect", "God keep you". Formal address to everyone, including enemies; oaths sworn on the Flame. |
| Monsters | invented | orcish / ogrish (Grukhar, Gorruk) | Guttural, no real-world accent. |

# Part 1 — The script in playing order

## Quest 1 — The Road from Lanternhold  *(Prologue)*

_Tesfaye says the two of you leave before dawn. He does not say why. Two men in the keep have already tried to make sure you never find out._

### Setting out

*Lanternhold, after the last bell. Tesfaye is standing in your doorway with a lamp, dressed for the road.*

**TESFAYE**  `q1_wake`

> [low, urgent] Wake, my child, and dress. Not the library robe — the travelling coat, and your boots. We leave Lanternhold tonight.
>
> [calm] I know you have questions. I have dreaded them for twenty years, and I will answer every one once we are past the gate and out of the hearing of these walls. Not before. Trust me in this as you have trusted me in everything.
>

> **What do you say?**
> 1. "Why tonight? What has happened?" — _question — the choice returns_
> 2. "You have never been afraid of anything. You are afraid now." — _question — the choice returns_
> 3. "I will get my things."
>

**TESFAYE** *(reply to 1)*  `q1_wake_why`

> [quietly] A message came at dusk, of the kind that is not written down. It said that people who wish you harm know where you are. Lanternhold, which I chose because nothing here changes and no one ever comes, has stopped being safe. That is all I will say inside these walls.
>

**TESFAYE** *(reply to 2)*  `q1_wake_afraid`

> [a breath] Yes. I am afraid. I have never lied to you and I will not begin tonight. Fear is not shameful, my child; it is a messenger. Mine says to have you on the road before the moon is up.
>

**TESFAYE** *(reply to 3)*  `q1_wake_go`

> [warm] Good.
>

**TESFAYE**  `q1_wake_ask`

> [careful] One thing before you go, and answer it truly. Has anyone spoken to you today whom you did not know? A pilgrim, a pedlar, a man asking directions. Anyone.
>

> **What do you say?**
> 1. "No one. The same faces as every day."
> 2. "A pilgrim at the well asked my name. I told him." — _sets toldName_
> 3. "Why? Who would come here?"
>

**TESFAYE** *(reply to 1)*  `q1_seen_nobody`

> [relieved] Then they are not inside the walls yet, and we have the hours I hoped for. Take what coin you have to Dawit at the storehouse and buy a true blade; the practice swords stay behind. Meet me at the gate at the second bell, and if anyone stops you between here and there — anyone — do not argue with them. Come to me.
>

**TESFAYE** *(reply to 2)*  `q1_seen_pilgrim`

> [very quiet] You told him. — No. It is not your fault; you had no reason not to. It means they are inside already, and it means we go now, not at the bell. Take your coin to Dawit at the storehouse and buy a true blade, and come straight back to me. Do not stop for anyone.
>

**TESFAYE** *(reply to 3)*  `q1_seen_why`

> [gently] Because the people I have feared for twenty years have found the one place I hoped they never would. That is the whole answer, and I will give you the rest on the road. Take your coin to Dawit at the storehouse and buy a true blade. Then the gate, at the second bell.
>

### Scene 1: The storehouse

*The storehouse. A stranger in a road-cloak is standing between the shelves. He is not one of the keepers.*

**NIB**  `q1_store`

> [easy] Evening. You'd be the old man's ward, then. Younger than I was told, and about to make somebody a good deal richer.
>
> [almost kindly] No call to make this hard. I've a purse to earn and a road to be on before sun-up, and you've got — what, a practice sword? Stand still and I'll make it quick.
>

> **What do you say?**
> 1. "Who paid you? Say the name and I let you walk." — _question — the choice returns; sets nibSeal_
> 2. "Richer for whom?" — _question — the choice returns_
> 3. "You have picked the wrong storehouse."
> 4. "Go. Run, and I will not follow." — _no fight; blood -1; sets nibSpared_
>

**NIB** *(reply to 1)*  `q1_nib_who`

> [a shrug] There's never a name, friend. A seal on a letter, a purse left at an inn, a description of a face. That's how it's done, and it's done that way so men like me can't answer questions like yours.
>

**NIB** *(reply to 2)*  `q1_nib_richer`

> [amused] For somebody who don't want to be spoken of. Two hundred in gold for the ward of Tesfaye of Lanternhold, alive or otherwise. That's a heap of money for a scholar's foundling, and I'll be honest, I did wonder why.
>

**NIB** *(reply to 3)*  `q1_nib_draw`

> [flat] Reckon I have.
>

**NIB** *(reply to 4)*  `q1_nib_run`

> [backing away] ...You're either real kind or real foolish, and I ain't paid enough to find out which.
>

### Scene 2: The priests' quarters

_(if not nibSpared)_

**TESFAYE**  `q1_cobb`

> [hard] Two of them, inside the keep, on the same night. Somebody bought a keeper's silence for that, and I mean to know whose. Later.
>
> [urgent] The one in the storehouse. Did he say anything before it ended? Who sent him — a name, a house, a mark?
>

> **What do you say?**
> 1. "No name. He said there is only ever a seal on a letter and a purse at an inn." — _if flag nibSeal_
> 2. "Two hundred in gold for me, alive or otherwise. He wondered why."
> 3. "I did not ask. There was no time."
>

**TESFAYE** *(reply to 1)*  `q1_cobb_seal`

> [grim] A seal. Then it is a house that wants you, not a man, and houses keep ledgers and ledgers keep names. That is the first useful thing anyone has told me in twenty years. Finish this one; we go the moment the gate opens.
>

**TESFAYE** *(reply to 2)*  `q1_cobb_bounty`

> [quiet] Two hundred. That is not a grudge; that is a budget. Somebody with money has decided you are worth it, and I would give a great deal to know how they came to that sum. Finish this one; we go the moment the gate opens.
>

**TESFAYE** *(reply to 3)*  `q1_cobb_nothing`

> [gently] No. There would not have been. It is a thing you learn: ask first, strike after, when you can. Finish this one; we go the moment the gate opens.
>

_(if flag nibSpared)_

**TESFAYE**  `q1_cobb_spared`

> [thoughtful] He went. That was kinder than I would have been in your place. Remember that it cost us nothing tonight; it will not always.
>
> [urgent] And here is a second one, in the brothers' quarters. Before you finish him — the first one. Did he say who sent him? A name, a house, a mark?
>

> **What do you say?**
> 1. "No name. He said there is only ever a seal on a letter and a purse at an inn." — _if flag nibSeal_
> 2. "Two hundred in gold for me, alive or otherwise. He wondered why."
> 3. "I did not ask. There was no time."
>

**TESFAYE** *(reply to 1)*  `q1_cobb_seal`

> [grim] A seal. Then it is a house that wants you, not a man, and houses keep ledgers and ledgers keep names. That is the first useful thing anyone has told me in twenty years. Finish this one; we go the moment the gate opens.
>

**TESFAYE** *(reply to 2)*  `q1_cobb_bounty`

> [quiet] Two hundred. That is not a grudge; that is a budget. Somebody with money has decided you are worth it, and I would give a great deal to know how they came to that sum. Finish this one; we go the moment the gate opens.
>

**TESFAYE** *(reply to 3)*  `q1_cobb_nothing`

> [gently] No. There would not have been. It is a thing you learn: ask first, strike after, when you can. Finish this one; we go the moment the gate opens.
>

### Scene 3: The Griffon Road, after dark

*The Griffon Road, after dark.*

**TESFAYE**  `q1_road`

> [quiet] Stay close, and keep to the shadow of the trees. This road is empty at night, and I have learned to dislike empty roads.
>
> [after a silence] {target}. In case I do not find a better moment — I have been proud of you every day since I carried you through that gate. Whatever you hear about yourself in the days to come, hold to that. A tree with deep roots laughs at the wind.
>
> [sharp] Torches. Ahead, and closing. Off the road — now.
>

### After the last fight

*A man in spiked black plate steps into the torchlight, taller than any man should be. Tesfaye puts himself between the giant and you.*

**KOLADE ADEYINKA**  `q1_appear`

> [calm, courteous] Tesfaye of Lanternhold. You have run a very long way to end up on a road at night with the one thing I want.
>
> [measured] Give the child to me, and you may keep your life and your library. It is not a small thing I offer. I will not offer it twice.
>

**TESFAYE**  `q1_refuse`

> [steady] You know my name; I do not know yours, and I find I do not care to. You will not have this child while I stand. Take that as my answer.
>

**KOLADE ADEYINKA**  `q1_question`

> [curious, unhurried] Before you die for it, old man, satisfy me on one point. Does the child know? Have you told it what it is, or have you let it grow up believing it is yours?
>

**TESFAYE**  `q1_answer`

> [level] It knows what I taught it. Letters, kindness, and how to hold a blade. That is all the knowing it needs, and more than you were ever given.
>
> [to the ward, fierce and low] Run. Do not look back, whatever you hear. Find the Open Hand Inn on the Shore Road. Ask for Beau and Delphine. Run!
>

**TESFAYE**  `q1_death`

> [struck through] Go —
>

_He dies._

**KOLADE ADEYINKA**  `q1_after`

> [unhurried, to the dark] Then it will learn the rest from me. Let the child run. The road is long, my friends, and I own most of it.
>

### Back in town

*A village at the edge of the hills, an hour before dawn. Someone small is running up the road behind you.*

**HIWOT**  `q1_catchup`

> [breathless] {target}! Oh, thank every saint that listens. I saw you both leave and I followed — yes, I know, I was not supposed to — and then I saw the torches, and the big one in the black armour, and I ran the other way, because I am not brave. I am only fast.
>
> [quieter] He is dead. Tesfaye. I saw him fall. I can't believe we left him there. He should be with us.
>
> [urgent] Tell me what the big one said to him. I was too far; I saw his mouth move and Tesfaye shake his head. What did he want?
>

> **What do you say?**
> 1. "Me. Tesfaye said no. We do what he told us — the Open Hand. Stay close to me." — _Hiwot +1_
> 2. "Later. Keep your voice down; grief will not help us, and it will get us found."
> 3. "He asked whether I knew what I am. I will find him, ask him what he meant, and take him apart." — _blood +1_
>

**HIWOT** *(reply to 1)*  `q1_wren_kind`

> [steadying] He wanted you. By name. Then it was never about Tesfaye at all. — Close. Yes. I can do close. I have his letter; it was in his coat. An inn on the Shore Road, and two names, Beau and Delphine. He must have meant for us to go to them.
>

**HIWOT** *(reply to 2)*  `q1_wren_cold`

> [stung, then flat] Right. I am fine. — I have his letter. An inn and two names. You may read it when you have finished being a wall.
>

**HIWOT** *(reply to 3)*  `q1_wren_dark`

> [uneasy] "What you are." He said that? — You sounded like him just then. Not Tesfaye. The other one. [softer] There is a letter. An inn, two names. Let us go and be alive first. You can be terrible later.
>

**HIWOT**  `q1_join`

> [firm] I am coming with you. I can pick locks and keep watch while you sleep. Besides, if you leave me here, I will only have to follow you again.
>

_Hiwot joins the company._

---

## Quest 2 — The Open Hand  *(Chapter 1)*

_Tesfaye's letter names an inn and two friends. The road there has wolves, a squire hunting them, and a mage on the steps who knows your face._

### Setting out

_(if Hiwot in company)_

**HIWOT**  `q2_road`

> [reading] "The Open Hand, on the Shore Road, past the salt-flats. Ask for Beau and Delphine. They are Wardens, and they were my friends before you were born. Trust them as you would trust me." — That is all it says. He never wasted ink.
>
> [thinking] Wardens. He never once said that word in twenty years, and now it is the first thing he wants us to know. That is the first thing I am asking them.
>

### Scene 1: The Shore Road

*The Shore Road. Two men are sitting on a milestone: one pale and long-haired, laughing at nothing; the other small and sour, watching you.*

**DESMOND**  `q2_pair`

> [bright] Well now — look at this, Winston. Two little travellers on a big empty road, and one of them holding a sword like it might bite.
>
> [delighted] Desmond. This is Winston. We are going the same way as you, which is a coincidence, and we are very good in a fight, which is not.
>

**WINSTON**  `q2_pair`

> [flat] He talks. I do the rest.
>

_(if Hiwot in company)_

**HIWOT**  `q2_pair_hiwot`

> [low, to you] Do not tell them anything. We do not know them.
>

**WINSTON**  `q2_pair_ask`

> [level] Before anybody says yes or no: where are two children walking so fast, with one blade between them and no pack? People with a reason walk like that. I want the reason.
>

> **What do you say?**
> 1. "An inn called the Open Hand. Friends of my father's. He is dead." — _sets toldPair_
> 2. "South. Family."
> 3. "That is my business."
>

**WINSTON** *(reply to 1)*  `q2_where_truth`

> [thoughtful] The Open Hand. That's a Warden house; everybody on this coast knows it. So you are walking toward trouble, not away from it, and you are honest about it. Both of those are useful to me.
>

**DESMOND** *(reply to 2)*  `q2_where_lie`

> [gleeful] Lying. Look at the hands, Winston — the hands always know. I like them already.
>
> [sing-song] No worry yourself. Everybody lies to us. We are used to it.
>

**WINSTON** *(reply to 3)*  `q2_where_refuse`

> [unbothered] Fair. It is. Then here is mine, so we are even.
>

**WINSTON**  `q2_pair_offer`

> [flat] We are hired blades between hirings, and the road is bad for two and better for four. Say yes or say no, but say it before the light goes. I do not like this stretch after dark.
>

> **What do you say?**
> 1. "Who are you, really? Nobody walks this road for the pleasure of it." — _question — the choice returns_
> 2. "Your friend is laughing at nothing. Is he well?" — _question — the choice returns_
> 3. "Four is better than two. Walk with us." — _Desmond +1; Winston +1; Desmond joins; Winston joins; sets umbralRecruited_
> 4. "We travel alone. Good road to you." — _sets umbralRefused_
>

**WINSTON** *(reply to 1)*  `q2_pair_who`

> [dry] You want the true answer or the polite one? Polite: two men with skills and no master this month. True: we work for people who pay to know things, and right now they would like to know why iron costs three times what it did last year. You are not the thing we are looking for. You are on the road to it.
>

**WINSTON** *(reply to 2)*  `q2_pair_vess`

> [a sigh] Desmond is well the way a fire is well. He can raise the dead for a little while and he laughs when the dead fall down again. I keep him pointed the right way. I have done it since we were boys and I am tired, but I am still doing it.
>

**DESMOND** *(reply to 3)*  `q2_pair_yes`

> [sing-song] You hear that, Winston? We have friends now. — No worry yourself, {target}. I bite only the ones you tell me to.
>

**WINSTON** *(reply to 4)*  `q2_pair_no`

> [unbothered] Then go easy. If you change your mind, we will be the ones ahead of you with the fire lit. — Desmond. Walk.
>

### Scene 2: The wolf den

_(if Hiwot in company)_

**HIWOT**  `q2_wolves`

> [low] Wolves. Road wolves, the big grey kind — Tesfaye said they only come down to the road when the hills are hungry.
>
> [very quiet] Something has made the hills hungry.
>

*A young man in a white tabard, running down the road towards you with his hand up.*

**SANTIAGO**  `q2_cassian`

> [formal, out of breath] Hold — with respect, hold! Do not go into the den, señor — señora — forgive me, I do not know which, and I have run a long way.
>
> [straightening] Santiago, squire of the Order of the Dawning Flame. I have been sent to clear these wolves from the road, and I have been sent alone.
>

_(if Hiwot in company)_

**HIWOT**  `q2_cassian_hiwot`

> [sceptical] Alone. Who sends one squire to a wolf den? What did you do to your Order?
>

_(if Hiwot in company)_

**SANTIAGO**  `q2_cassian_answer`

> [reddening, honest] Nothing. That is the difficulty. A knight who has done nothing is sent to do something, and a wolf den on a road nobody uses is the something. I will confess to you, as I would to no one in the Order, that I am not certain I can.
>

> **What do you say?**
> 1. "The Dawning Flame. What is that?" — _question — the choice returns_
> 2. "Then we clear them together, and you may tell your Order whatever you like." — _Santiago +1; Santiago joins_
> 3. "A knight who cannot manage wolves. What do they teach in that Order?" — _question — the choice returns; Santiago +1_
> 4. "We are in a hurry. Manage your own wolves."
>

**SANTIAGO** *(reply to 1)*  `q2_cassian_order`

> [earnest] An order of knights sworn to the sun and the sunrise: to be first into the dark and last out of it. Our chapter house is far south of here, in the sun-lands, where I was born. The Order sent me north to learn what the roads are like. I am learning.
>

**SANTIAGO** *(reply to 2)*  `q2_cassian_join`

> [relieved] God keep you for it. Then I will take the front, because that is what I am for, and you will tell me if I am doing it wrong.
>

**SANTIAGO** *(reply to 3)*  `q2_cassian_tease`

> [reddening, then honest] Prayers, mostly. And the sword, and how to stand still while people say unkind things — which, with respect, you are doing very well.
>

**SANTIAGO** *(reply to 4)*  `q2_cassian_no`

> [formal, hurt] Of course. God go with you, then. I will — I will manage.
>

_(if Hiwot not in company)_

**SANTIAGO**  `q2_cassian_alone`

> [honest] I will confess to you, as I would to no one in the Order, that I am not certain I can. I have never fought anything that was not a straw man.
>

> **What do you say?**
> 1. "The Dawning Flame. What is that?" — _question — the choice returns_
> 2. "Then we clear them together, and you may tell your Order whatever you like." — _Santiago +1; Santiago joins_
> 3. "A knight who cannot manage wolves. What do they teach in that Order?" — _question — the choice returns; Santiago +1_
> 4. "We are in a hurry. Manage your own wolves."

### Scene 3: The steps of the Open Hand

*The Open Hand Inn. A lean man in a patched coat sits on the steps with a sheet of paper in one hand and a wand in the other.*

**MERLE**  `q2_morwin`

> [drawling, on the inn steps] Well, look here. Two of you, and a paper in my pocket with one face on it. Now which one's the ward of Tesfaye of Lanternhold? Don't all shout at once.
>

_(if Hiwot in company)_

**HIWOT**  `q2_morwin_hiwot`

> [quickly] Neither. We are pilgrims. Going to the shrine at — the shrine.
>

_(if Hiwot in company)_

**MERLE**  `q2_morwin_hiwot_reply`

> [amused] Pilgrims. With that face, that the paper's got drawn near perfect. Nice try, little sister.
>
> [unhurried] Merle. I'm the fella they send when the first fella don't come back. Now I'll say this once: I'd sooner do this out here than in Delphine's yard. That woman scares me.
>

> **What do you say?**
> 1. "Whose name is on that paper? Who is paying?" — _question — the choice returns_
> 2. "How did you know to wait here?" — _question — the choice returns_
> 3. "You should have stayed home, Merle." — _blood +1_
> 4. "Delphine! Beau! There is a man on your steps who means murder!"
>

**MERLE** *(reply to 1)*  `q2_morwin_name`

> [chuckling] Same as always. A seal, no name. Iron hand on red wax, pressed hard, like whoever did it was angry at the wax. If you want a name you'll have to go up the road a good deal further than me.
>

**MERLE** *(reply to 2)*  `q2_morwin_how`

> [a shrug] The old man had two friends in the whole world, and they run this inn. Anybody who knew him knew that. Whoever's paying knew him.
>

**MERLE** *(reply to 3)*  `q2_morwin_kill`

> [grinning] Now there's the temper the paper warned me about.
>

**MERLE** *(reply to 4)*  `q2_morwin_inn`

> [cursing] Oh, that's low. That's — I hear the door. All right. All right, quick then.
>

_(if Hiwot not in company)_

**MERLE**  `q2_morwin_alone`

> [unhurried] Merle. I'm the fella they send when the first fella don't come back. I'd sooner do this out here than in Delphine's yard. That woman scares me.

### After the last fight

_(if Hiwot in company)_

**HIWOT**  `q2_notice`

> [picking up the paper] He was carrying this. Your face, and a bounty, and a seal of an iron hand in red wax. No name.
>
> [quiet] Somebody with a great deal of money wants you dead badly enough to send two men in one night and a third to wait at the one door Tesfaye trusted. I am keeping this. Somebody at that inn will know the mark.
>

### Back in town

*The inn door opens. A broad man with a shield on his back, and behind him a woman with grey in her braids and a look that has already counted you.*

**BEAU**  `q2_selene`

> [stammering, warm] You're — y-you're his. Tesfaye's. I'd know that coat anywhere; he w-wore it the day we met. Come in. Come in out of the road.
>
> [quiet] Del. It's the ward. He sent the ward.
>

**DELPHINE**  `q2_selene`

> [blunt] Sit down before you fall down, honey. Both of you. Beau, get the good bread.
>
> [steady] Tesfaye wrote to us every year for twenty years, and every letter said the same thing: if the child ever comes to your door alone, it means I am dead, and you are to do what I would have done.
>
> [quiet, direct] So. How did he die? All of it. Don't you spare me.
>

> **What do you say?**
> 1. "A man in black plate, taller than a man should be. He asked for me by name. Tesfaye said no." — _sets toldArmour_
> 2. "Quickly. He did not suffer."
> 3. "I cannot. Not tonight."
>

**DELPHINE** *(reply to 1)*  `q2_how_armour`

> [very still] Black plate. Asked for you by name.
>
> [to Beau] Beau. The letter from the spring. He said if a big man in black iron ever came asking, we weren't to fight him, we were to run with the child and ask questions after. I thought he'd gone strange.
>

**DELPHINE** *(reply to 2)*  `q2_how_quick`

> [gently] That's a kindness, and a lie, and I'll take both. Thank you, sugar.
>
> [to Beau] Beau. Whoever did it knew where Tesfaye was, and Tesfaye chose that library because nobody knew. Somebody talked.
>

**DELPHINE** *(reply to 3)*  `q2_how_refuse`

> [soft] Then don't. But you'll tell Beau when you can; he loved him too, and he's worse at waiting than I am.
>

**BEAU**  `q2_beau_seal`

> [low] Del. The p-paper the man on the steps had. Look at the seal. Iron hand, red wax.
>
> [steadier] That's the mark on the ore wagons. The ones that come up from Dunmere and go north. I've seen it a hundred times at the ford.
>

**DELPHINE**  `q2_selene_seal`

> [looking] It is. The Iron Consortium's mark — the trading house out of the Gate that's been buying every bar on this coast since the ore went bad.
>
> [slowly] So the folks paying to kill Tesfaye's ward are the folks who own the iron. That ain't two stories, honey. That's one. Now you ask me whatever you need to, and then we decide what he'd have done.
>

> **What do you say?**
> 1. "What are the Wardens? He never told me." — _question — the choice returns_
> 2. "Why would a trading house pay two hundred in gold for a scholar's foundling?" — _question — the choice returns_
> 3. "He trusted you. So will I. Tell me what he would have done." — _Delphine +1; Beau +1_
> 4. "I did not come for bread. Tell me who killed him and I will go alone." — _blood +1; Delphine -1_
>

**DELPHINE** *(reply to 1)*  `q2_selene_wardens`

> [matter-of-fact] Folks who keep the balance between the towns and the wild, and between the strong and the weak, when the law's too far off to do it. Tesfaye was one, before the library. So are we. It don't pay, and nobody thanks you, and you do it anyway. That's the whole of the oath.
>

**DELPHINE** *(reply to 2)*  `q2_selene_why`

> [carefully] I don't know, and I won't pretend I do. I know Tesfaye hid you like a man hides a lit candle in a wind, and never said from what. A trading house don't spend two hundred on spite. They think you're worth it, or they think you're dangerous, and I can't tell you which from here.
>

**DELPHINE** *(reply to 3)*  `q2_selene_trust`

> [softening] He'd have followed the money. The iron's gone bad since spring — tools snapping, blades cracking, every smith from here to the Gate cussing — and the ore comes up out of Dunmere. The Consortium's mark is on the wagons and on your bounty. So we go to Dunmere and find out what's wrong with that ore, and I'd bet my house we find out who wants you dead the same day.
>

**DELPHINE** *(reply to 4)*  `q2_selene_alone`

> [flat] You'll go with us or you'll go over my husband, and he's a big man. Tesfaye asked. I don't break a promise to a dead friend because a child is grieving and rude about it.
>

**DELPHINE**  `q2_join`

> [decisive] Beau, get the shields. We're going to Dunmere.
>
> [to you] I'll tell you what: you're Tesfaye's, and Tesfaye's is ours. That's all the reason we need, and it's all the reason you're getting tonight.
>

_Beau, Delphine join the company._

## Quest 3 — South to Dunmere  *(Chapter 2)*

_The tainted iron comes from the Dunmere mines. Between here and there: Thornbury, an elf with a grudge, a knife in an inn, and a gnoll fortress with a witch in it._

### Setting out

_(if Delphine in company)_

**DELPHINE**  `q3_south`

> [calm] Dunmere's two days south. Mining town, hard folk, honest as far as it goes. The mayor's a man called Gethin Pryce; he'll be sweating, and he'll pay.
>
> [dry] Stay off the river road after dark. Gnolls come down it. I know because I've buried the people who didn't listen.
>

**DELPHINE**  `q3_south_hiwot`

> [casual, not casual] Hiwot. You grew up in that library with him. Did he keep letters? Anything from the Gate, anything with that iron seal on it?
>

**HIWOT**  `q3_south_hiwot`

> [thinking] A locked drawer in his study. I never got it open, and I tried twice, which he knew, because he moved the key. He never moved anything else.
>
> [quiet] It is still there. Whatever it is.
>

**DELPHINE**  `q3_south_hiwot_reply`

> [nodding] Then it's still there. Remember that, both of you. If this road ever bends back toward Lanternhold, that drawer's the first door we open.
>

### Scene 1: The Dunmere inn

*The road south. An elf in grey steps out of the trees with his hands where you can see them.*

**ITSUKI**  `q3_ithrel`

> [quiet, from the treeline] Forgive me. I do not mean to alarm you. I have walked beside your road for an hour, deciding whether to speak.
>
> [level] You are going north to the Gate, by the river road? — Then I will be plain. I am Itsuki. A year ago an ogre called Gorruk, who leads the bandit companies in the north, burned a wagon on this road. My wife was in it. I have hunted him since, alone, and alone I cannot reach him.
>

_(if Delphine in company)_

**DELPHINE**  `q3_ithrel_selene`

> [sharp] A year hunting one ogre alone, and the Wardens never heard of you. Why didn't you come to us?
>

_(if Delphine in company)_

**ITSUKI**  `q3_ithrel_selene_reply`

> [calm] I did. A man at a Warden house on the coast told me the north road is not the Wardens' road. He was polite about it.
>

_(if Delphine in company)_

**DELPHINE**  `q3_ithrel_selene_after`

> [a beat] ...It ain't. Damn it. It should be.
>

**ITSUKI**  `q3_ithrel_ask`

> [level] You are going towards him. I would go with you. I ask nothing else.
>

> **What do you say?**
> 1. "Gorruk. Does he use a seal? An iron hand in red wax?" — _question — the choice returns_
> 2. "Your wife. I am sorry. What was her name?" — _question — the choice returns; Itsuki +1_
> 3. "Walk with us. When we find him, he is yours." — _Itsuki +2; Itsuki joins_
> 4. "I have enough grief in this company. I do not need yours." — _Itsuki -1_
>

**ITSUKI** *(reply to 1)*  `q3_ithrel_seal`

> [thinking] I have seen letters carried to his camp. Sealed. I did not read them; I was too far, and I am no thief. The seal was red, and pressed hard. That is all I can say honestly.
>

**ITSUKI** *(reply to 2)*  `q3_ithrel_wife`

> [a long pause] Hana. Thank you for asking. No one asks. They ask about him.
>

**ITSUKI** *(reply to 3)*  `q3_ithrel_yes`

> [a small bow] Then I am in your debt before I have earned my place. I will keep the rear. You will not hear me unless you need to.
>

**ITSUKI** *(reply to 4)*  `q3_ithrel_no`

> [calm] I understand. I will walk on ahead of you, then. If our roads cross again, I will not ask twice.
>

*The Dunmere inn, first night. A woman at a corner table raises her cup to you.*

**LURLEEN**  `q3_lessa`

> [smiling, from a corner table] There you are, sugar. I've been nursing this cider an hour, waiting on you. Lurleen. You don't know me, but I know that face; I've got it on paper in my pocket.
>
> [light] Three sent before me, I hear. And one of them Merle, who I liked. So this ain't only money now. Just so you know.
>

_(if Winston in company)_

**WINSTON**  `q3_lessa_winston`

> [flat] Before the knives, girl. What's the rate? Two hundred, still, or has it gone up since Merle?
>

_(if Winston in company)_

**LURLEEN**  `q3_lessa_winston_reply`

> [amused] Three now. It goes up every time one of us don't come back. You thinking of switching sides, halfling?
>

_(if Winston in company)_

**WINSTON**  `q3_lessa_winston_after`

> [dry] Thinking about who can afford to keep raising it. Carry on.
>

**LURLEEN**  `q3_lessa_ask`

> [light] Well? You going to say something clever, or are we going to get on with it?
>

> **What do you say?**
> 1. "Why do you do this work?" — _question — the choice returns_
> 2. "Then let it be personal."
>

**LURLEEN** *(reply to 1)*  `q3_lessa_why`

> [a shrug] Because I'm good at it, and because nobody else in this country pays a woman to be good at anything. You'd know, if you'd grown up anywhere but a library.
>

**LURLEEN** *(reply to 2)*  `q3_lessa_fight`

> [pleased] There she is. — There he is. Whichever. Come on, then.
>

### Scene 2: The river crossing

*The river crossing below the gnoll fortress. A huge man with a hamster on his shoulder is shouting at a wizard in red at the ford.*

**BAHADIR**  `q3_bramm`

> [booming] — and I say AGAIN, red man, you touch that cage and I will fold you into it!
>
> [turning] VALLAHI. Strangers. Good. Strangers, listen: Bahadır, ranger of Kalden, and this is Fındık, who is small but very brave. There is a woman in that fortress, in a cage. Yasemin. A witch of my country, and a good one.
>

**DEVENDRA**  `q3_bramm`

> [disdainful] Kindly disregard the large gentleman; his enthusiasms are exhausting. Devendra, Crimson Wizard of Vashk. The woman in the cage is a Kalden witch, and it is quite evident that a Kalden witch loose in these hills is a calamity waiting for a date.
>

**BAHADIR**  `q3_bramm_argue`

> [hot] Tell them why Vashk burns women, wizard! Tell them what your Crimson masters do with a witch's bones!
>

**DEVENDRA**  `q3_bramm_argue`

> [coolly] Vashk and Kalden have been at war, in one form or another, since before these strangers' grandparents were born. I do not expect the large gentleman to understand policy. I expect him to understand a hundred in gold — which I am offering to you, not to him. A hundred to see her burned, and my considerable talents beside you until the Gate.
>

> **What do you say?**
> 1. "Why would a Crimson Wizard care what happens to one witch?" — _question — the choice returns_
> 2. "We are freeing her. Bahadır, with me." — _blood -1; Bahadır +2; Bahadır joins_
> 3. "A hundred gold, and your staff until the Gate. Done." — _blood +1; gold +100; Devendra +1; Devendra joins; sets brammEnemy_
> 4. "The witch lives, and the wizard walks with us and holds his tongue about it." — _Bahadır +1; Devendra -1; Bahadır joins; Devendra joins_
>

**DEVENDRA** *(reply to 1)*  `q3_bramm_why`

> [coolly] Because one witch becomes a coven, and a coven becomes a border dispute, and a border dispute becomes my problem. That I am polite about it is a courtesy, not a change of policy.
>

**BAHADIR** *(reply to 2)*  `q3_bramm_rescue`

> [overjoyed] With you! Yes! Fındık, did you hear? We have friends, and they are good ones. Come — the gate is that way, and I am going through it.
>

**DEVENDRA** *(reply to 3)*  `q3_bramm_coin`

> [satisfied] A sensible arrangement. The large gentleman will object; I recommend we not be near him when he does.
>

**DEVENDRA** *(reply to 4)*  `q3_bramm_both`

> [thin] Hold my tongue. Very well. I shall hold it most eloquently. Do not expect me to be happy about it.
>

### Scene 3: The gnoll fortress — or Bahadır blocks the road (if aurelius)

_(if flag brammEnemy)_

**BAHADIR**  `q3_road_block`

> [wounded, roaring] You TOOK his coin. You looked at me and you took his coin! Then you go through me, and Fındık, and every tree in this valley — come on! COME ON!
>

### After the last fight

*The cage in the fortress yard. A woman in a dark robe waits inside it, quite calm.*

_(if Bahadır recruited)_

**YASEMIN**  `q3_freed`

> [cold, from the cage] Thank you. I would kneel, but the bars have made it difficult.
>
> [looking at you] You. Come closer. Something in your blood woke when you came through the fortress gate; I felt it through the bars like heat from a stove in the next room. I have read auras all my life and I have never felt one like it.
>
> [direct] So tell me, before I decide what to do about it. When it woke — what did it want?
>

> **What do you say?**
> 1. "The warleader's throat. I gave it that." — _blood +1_
> 2. "I felt nothing. I fought, and it ended."
> 3. "You tell me. What is it? Say it plainly." — _question — the choice returns_
> 4. "Whatever you felt, keep it to yourself in front of the others."
>

**YASEMIN** *(reply to 1)*  `q3_ysolde_blood`

> [a slow nod] Honest. Good. Then I know what kind of thing it is, if not its name: something that was worshipped once, and fed. I would sooner walk beside it than behind it. Bahadır goes where I go, and Fındık goes where Bahadır goes, and so you have three. Two and a half.
>

**YASEMIN** *(reply to 2)*  `q3_ysolde_nothing`

> [dry] You felt nothing. Canım, I watched your hand. — Very well; you are not ready to say it, and that is your right. I will walk beside you anyway, and I will keep watching the hand. Bahadır goes where I go.
>

**YASEMIN** *(reply to 3)*  `q3_ysolde_what`

> [precise] Something that was worshipped once, and should not have been. That is as plain as I can be without lying to you. I read auras, not histories. Now answer mine.
>

**YASEMIN** *(reply to 4)*  `q3_ysolde_quiet`

> [dry] As you like. I am a witch. Keeping things to myself is most of the work. I will walk beside you, and I will not say it again in front of the others. Bahadır goes where I go.
>

_(if Bahadır recruited)_

**BAHADIR**  `q3_joined`

> [emphatic] We are yours, {target}. Vallahi. Where you go, we go, and anyone who says otherwise answers to Fındık.
>

_Yasemin joins the company._

### Back in town

*Dunmere. The mayor meets you in the square, mopping his face with a handkerchief.*

**GETHIN PRYCE**  `q3_tollan`

> [harried, Welsh sing-song] Now then. You'll be Delphine's lot, is it? She sent a boy ahead with a note. Duw, I've been praying somebody would come, and I'm not a praying man.
>
> [wiping his face] Gethin Pryce, mayor of Dunmere, for my sins. The ore's gone bad — comes up grey and brittle and the smiths won't touch it, and my crews won't go below the second level, and I don't blame them.
>

_(if Delphine in company)_

**DELPHINE**  `q3_tollan_selene`

> [level] Gethin. Before the crews. Who's been buying your bad ore since spring, and who's been selling the smiths good iron since?
>

_(if Delphine in company)_

**GETHIN PRYCE**  `q3_tollan_selene_reply`

> [bitter] Same hand, bach, and you know it or you wouldn't ask. The Iron Consortium out of the Gate takes every wagon — they've the roads. They've been very sorry about the bad ore. Very sorry, and very quick to sell the smiths their own stock instead, at a price.
>

_(if Delphine in company)_

**DELPHINE**  `q3_tollan_selene_after`

> [to Beau, quiet] Same hand. Beau, I told you. Buy the ore cheap because it's bad, sell the iron dear because it's the only good iron left. Somebody's making that ore bad on purpose.
>

_(if Winston in company, Delphine not in company)_

**WINSTON**  `q3_tollan_winston`

> [flat] Mayor. Who takes your wagons north? One buyer, or many?
>

_(if Winston in company, Delphine not in company)_

**GETHIN PRYCE**  `q3_tollan_winston_reply`

> [bitter] One. The Iron Consortium out of the Gate. They've the roads, so they've the ore, and they've been very sorry about it being bad, and very quick to sell the smiths good iron of their own instead.
>

_(if Winston in company, Delphine not in company)_

**WINSTON**  `q3_tollan_winston_after`

> [low, to himself] One buyer. That's what they wanted to know. — Go on, man.
>

**GETHIN PRYCE**  `q3_tollan_ask`

> [hopeful] So. Will you go down, and what will it cost me? Say it plain; I've no head for haggling today.
>

> **What do you say?**
> 1. "What did your crews see, before they stopped going down?" — _question — the choice returns_
> 2. "Who profits when your iron goes bad?" — _question — the choice returns_
> 3. "We will go down. Two hundred in gold, and the town's thanks." — _gold +100; Hiwot +1; sets tollanFee_
> 4. "We will go down. Pay what the town can spare." — _Delphine +1; Santiago +1_
>

**GETHIN PRYCE** *(reply to 1)*  `q3_tollan_crews`

> [low] Lights, on the fourth level, where there's no lamps. Chanting. And a man — the last crew that came up swore it was a man, big, in a robe, standing by something like an altar. They didn't stay to ask him his business, and I don't blame them for that either.
>

**GETHIN PRYCE** *(reply to 2)*  `q3_tollan_iron`

> [bitter] Whoever's selling good iron while mine's bad. There's one house doing that on this coast, and it's the Consortium, and I've said so to the magistrate twice and got a shrug both times.
>

**GETHIN PRYCE** *(reply to 3)*  `q3_tollan_fee`

> [wincing] Two hundred. There's lovely. — Fine. Fine! Half now and half when you come up, and if you come up with clean ore I'll carry you round the square myself.
>

**GETHIN PRYCE** *(reply to 4)*  `q3_tollan_yes`

> [nearly weeping] Bless you. Bless you, I mean it. It won't be much, but it'll be everything we've got, and the whole town will know your name.
>

## Quest 4 — The Dunmere Mines  *(Chapter 2)*

_The miners will not go down. Whatever is fouling the ore is four levels below, and it has a priest._

### Setting out

_One of the following, whoever is riding along:_

**HIWOT**  `q4_down`

> [low] It smells like wet dog and hot metal. Four levels of that, going down.
>
> [quiet] If I go quiet down here it is not because I am frightened. It is because I am very frightened, and I would rather you did not know.
>

**DELPHINE**  `q4_down`

> [calm] Mind the timbers; half of them are rotten. If the kobolds are as thick as the mayor says, we go slow and we keep the healer in the middle. That's me, honey. Don't argue.
>

### Scene 1: The first level

_(combat, no dialogue)_

### Scene 2: The flooded level

_(if Delphine in company)_

**DELPHINE**  `q4_flooded`

> [calm] Water on the second level, and not from any spring. Somebody opened a channel and let the river in on purpose.
>
> [thoughtful] Kobolds don't plan. Kobolds dig where they're pointed. Whoever's pointing them is below us, and has been for weeks.
>

### Scene 3: The third level

_(combat, no dialogue)_

### Scene 4: Grukhar's chamber

*The fourth level opens into a chamber with a black altar. A half-orc in a priest's robe stands behind it, and he has been waiting a long time.*

**GRUKHAR**  `q4_chamber`

> [hoarse] So. Somebody finally came down. The crews have been whispering about a company from the coast for a week; I hoped you were bringing my pay.
>
> [bitter] They lied about that part. I have not seen a coin since spring. I have letters — orders, names, the whole rotten trade. Let me walk out of this hole and they are yours.
>

_(if Delphine in company)_

**DELPHINE**  `q4_grukhar_selene`

> [flat] Your orders. Sealed how? Iron hand, red wax, pressed hard.
>

_(if Delphine in company)_

>

_(if Delphine in company)_

**DELPHINE**  `q4_grukhar_selene_after`

> [to you, low] On a wagon, on a bounty, and now on an altar. That's three. — Go on, honey. He's yours to deal with.
>

> **What do you say?**
> 1. "Who lied to you? Say the names." — _question — the choice returns_
> 2. "Why foul the ore at all? Who profits from a town starving?" — _question — the choice returns_
> 3. "Leave the letters on the altar and walk. Now, before I change my mind." — _no fight; blood -1; Itsuki -1; Santiago -1; sets grukharSpared_
> 4. "I will take the letters off your body." — _blood +1_
>

**GRUKHAR** *(reply to 1)*  `q4_grukhar_who`

> [hoarse] A courier called Femi, who keeps a room at the inn in Thornbury and calls himself a wine merchant. Above him, something that signs itself Gorruk and holds the north road. Above THAT, I never met. Nobody meets it. The money used to come down the same way the orders do.
>

**GRUKHAR** *(reply to 2)*  `q4_grukhar_why`

> [a laugh like a cough] You think I asked? Somebody wants iron dear this year. Somebody wants the smiths of the Gate buying from one hand. I was told to keep this mine useless until the spring shipment, and I did, and I was to be paid for it, and I was not.
>

**GRUKHAR** *(reply to 3)*  `q4_grukhar_walk`

> [relieved, backing away] The altar. Read the one with the ogre's mark first; it names the courier and the inn.
>
> [muttering] Veylan keep me. I am finished with iron.
>

**GRUKHAR** *(reply to 4)*  `q4_grukhar_kill`

> [snarling] Then come and take them, foundling.

_(if Winston in company, Delphine not in company)_

**WINSTON**  `q4_grukhar_winston`

> [flat] Which spring shipment, priest? Whose wagons?
>

_(if Winston in company, Delphine not in company)_

**GRUKHAR**  `q4_grukhar_winston_reply`

> [hoarse] The Consortium's. They're the ones who hired me. You'll find the details in those letters.

_(if Delphine not in company)_

**GRUKHAR**  `q4_chamber_ask`

### After the last fight

_One of the following, whoever is riding along:_

**DELPHINE**  `q4_letters`

> [reading] "To the priest, from Femi at the Thornbury inn. Keep the ore fouled until the spring shipment. Gorruk holds the north road; do not use it without his mark."
>
> [calm] A courier, and a bandit lord above him, and above them somebody who buys with a seal instead of a name. The mine was only the bottom of this.
>

**HIWOT**  `q4_letters`

### Back in town

**GETHIN PRYCE**  `q4_thanks`

> [overjoyed] The crews went down at dawn and came up with clean ore. Clean! I haven't heard a bar ring true on that anvil since winter. Duw, I could sing.
>
> [earnest] Dunmere owes you more than it can pay, bach. Here's what it can. And — if you go north after the people who did this, the town would take it kindly if you didn't come back alone.
>

**HIWOT**  `q4_camp_hiwot`

> [quiet, at the fire] Delphine. Was he a good Warden? Tesfaye. He never talked about it, and I have been wondering all day whether that was because it was bad, or because it was good.
>

**DELPHINE**  `q4_camp_selene`

> [after a moment] He was the best of us, sugar. And he quit. Those ain't two different stories either.
>

*That night you dream of a field of ash, and a throne of black stone standing in it. Tesfaye is beside it, as though he has always been there.*

**TESFAYE**  `q4_dream`

> [echoing] You are dreaming, my child, and I am dead, and both of those things are true at once.
>
> [gentle] There is a throne in this dream. You will see it more clearly each time you come here. Do not sit in it. Do not look at it for long.
>
> [fading] Something in your blood is waking. You can feed it or you can starve it. That is the only choice that matters, and you will make it more than once.
>

> **What do you say?**
> 1. "What am I, Tesfaye? Tell me plainly." — _question — the choice returns_
> 2. "I do not want whatever this is. Starve it." — _blood -1; sets dream1_
> 3. "Show me the throne." — _blood +1; sets dream1_
>

**TESFAYE** *(reply to 1)*  `q4_dream_ask`

> [sorrowful] If I could, I would. Dreams are not letters; they carry only what you already half-know. You are the child of something that should have stayed dead — and you are mine. Both. Only the second is yours to keep.
>

**TESFAYE** *(reply to 2)*  `q4_dream_reject`

> [warm] Good. That is the harder road, and the right one. You will wake with a gift for closing wounds. Spend it on other people.
>

**TESFAYE** *(reply to 3)*  `q4_dream_embrace`

> [grieving] I cannot stop you here; only you can. You will wake with a gift for opening wounds. Mind what it makes you want.

## Quest 5 — The Bandit Camp  *(Chapter 3)*

_Grukhar's letters name a courier in Thornbury and a lord of bandits in the Gnashing Wood. Yohannes says go north. He does not say it will be pleasant._

### Setting out

*An old man in a grey cloak sits on the stable wall in Thornbury, eating an apple. You have seen him three times this week.*

**YOHANNES**  `q5_sage`

> [amused] You have looked at me three times this week, my child, and decided each time that I was nobody. That is a good instinct. It is wrong this once.
>
> [calm] I am called Yohannes. Tesfaye was my friend before this town had a wall, and I have watched his ward from a distance because that is what he asked of me, and because I am a coward about goodbyes.
>
> [quiet, exact] Now. Before I tell you anything, tell me something. The man in black on the Griffon Road. What did he say to Tesfaye? Word for word, if you can.
>

> **What do you say?**
> 1. ""Give the child to me and you may keep your life and your library."" — _sets toldYohannes_
> 2. "I did not hear it. I was running, as I was told."
> 3. "Ask him yourself, old man. I am going to." — _blood +1_
>

**YOHANNES** *(reply to 1)*  `q5_test_word`

> [very still] "Your library." He knew about the library. Then he has known where you were for years, and waited, and chose his night. That is worse than I feared and better than I guessed: a patient man can be found. — Ask me what you like. I will answer what I can.
>

**YOHANNES** *(reply to 2)*  `q5_test_forget`

> [gently] Then you did as you were told, and you are alive to be asked, and that is the whole of what Tesfaye wanted from that night. Ask me what you like. I will answer what I can.
>

**YOHANNES** *(reply to 3)*  `q5_test_refuse`

> [chuckling] Tesfaye said you would be like this. He said it fondly, mostly. — Ask me what you like, before you go and do it.
>

**YOHANNES**  `q5_sage_ask`

> [dry] Well? I can see you are not satisfied. Tell me what you want to know.
>

> **What do you say?**
> 1. "Why did Tesfaye die? You know. Say it." — _question — the choice returns_
> 2. "The man in black armour. Who is he?" — _question — the choice returns_
> 3. "Then help. Not riddles — help."
> 4. "North, then. Stay out of my way, old man." — _blood +1_
>

**YOHANNES** *(reply to 1)*  `q5_torvald_why`

> [gently] He died so that you would live long enough to be told properly, by the right person, in the right place. That place is not a stable yard in Thornbury, and I am not the right person; I am only the one who knew him longest.
>
> [calm] Go north. Find the letters. Paper will bring you to the truth faster than I would, and you will believe paper where you would not believe me.
>

**YOHANNES** *(reply to 2)*  `q5_torvald_armour`

> [carefully] I have not seen his face. I have seen his work. He does not want you dead for anything you have done; he wants you dead for what you are, and he is not the only one who will. That is as much as I will say before you have earned the rest.
>

**YOHANNES** *(reply to 3)*  `q5_torvald_help`

> [dry] I have helped. Twice. You did not see either time, which is what help from me looks like.
>
> [warm] The courier you want keeps a room at the inn here; the bandits are north, in the Gnashing Wood. Bring the letters out alive. That is the help I need from you.
>

**YOHANNES** *(reply to 4)*  `q5_torvald_go`

> [calm] The inn, for the courier. The Gnashing Wood, for the rest. Go well, child, since you will go anyway.
>

### Scene 1: Hollister's Inn

*Hollister's Inn. A soft man in a merchant's coat has a table to himself and a cup he has not touched.*

**FEMI**  `q5_inn`

> [nervous, city-polished] I do not know you. I do not know any priest, or any mine. I am a wine merchant, my friend, and I should like you to leave my table.
>

_(if Delphine in company)_

**DELPHINE**  `q5_inn_selene`

> [pleasant, deadly] Hollister says you've had that room since the spring, Femi. Now I'll tell you what puzzles me. What does a wine merchant sell for six months in a town with one inn, that already has a cellar?
>

_(if Delphine in company)_

**FEMI**  `q5_inn_selene_reply`

> [sweating] Ah-ah — madam, I do not answer to — I have a licence, I have papers —

_(if Delphine in company)_

**DELPHINE**  `q5_inn_selene_after`

> [to you] He's got papers, honey. I'd like to see them.

> **What do you say?**
> 1. "A priest under Dunmere had your letters. Your name, your inn, your hand." — _question — the choice returns_
> 2. "Wrong answer."
> 3. "Fifty in gold for the camp's location. Then you leave this town tonight." — _no fight; gold -50; sets verlanPaid_

>

**FEMI** *(reply to 1)*  `q5_verlan_letters`

### Scene 2: Holloway Vale

_(if Santiago in company)_

**SANTIAGO**  `q5_patrol`

> [uneasy] Burning Gauntlet. A patrol, this far south of the city. They have someone at sword-point — and with respect, by her look, she is not from anywhere near here.
>

*Holloway Vale. Three soldiers in the flame-tabard of the Burning Gauntlet have a woman in grey on her knees at the roadside.*

**LAYLA**  `q5_patrol`

> [cold] Yes. Stare. A dark elf, above ground, in daylight. You will not see another.
>
> [contemptuous] I am a priestess, and a fugitive, and there is a bounty on me that these three would like to collect. I cured a village of the coughing sickness on my way here. They are arresting me for having the wrong face. Decide what that makes you.
>

_(if Santiago in company)_

**SANTIAGO**  `q5_patrol_cassian`

> [formal, tight] A priestess of what, señora? Say it. I would know what I am deciding about.

_(if Santiago in company)_

**LAYLA**  `q5_patrol_cassian_reply`

> [level] Of a goddess your Order has no name for, boy, and would not like if it did. Does it change your sword arm?

**LAYLA** *(reply to 1)*  `q5_ilvara_why`

>

**LAYLA** *(reply to 2)*  `q5_ilvara_defend`

### Scene 4: Gorruk's tent

*The lord's tent. A man in chains, a chest, and an ogre in a mage's coat rising from the cot.*

**CAL BOONE**  `q5_tent`

> [hoarse, drawling] Visitors. Well, ain't that fine. Y'all here for me, or for the ogre? Say me. Please say me.

> [urgent] Cal Boone — Warden, or I was 'fore the chain. That chest by the cot is full of letters, and every last one of 'em carries the same seal. Take the chest. Take me. In that order, if it's got to be.

**CAL BOONE**  `q5_letters`

> [grinning through a split lip] Told you. Every one sealed with the iron hand. The Iron Consortium — the trading house in the Gate — pays for the mine, for these bandits, and for you.
>
> [serious] There's a second name under theirs. A mage called Olamide, in the Mirkhollow. They call his place "the other mine." I heard it twice through that tent wall, and men don't say a thing twice unless it matters.

_(if Delphine in company)_

**DELPHINE**  `q5_letters_selene`

_(if Delphine in company)_

**CAL BOONE**  `q5_letters_selene_reply`

> [thinking] No name on the paper, Del, I'll swear to that. But the ogre said "the Gate office" like it was one man, and once — only once — "Adeyinka." Said it the way a fella says a name he's scared of.

### Back in town

_(if any of: flag ilvaraSaved / Desmond recruited, Santiago recruited)_

## Quest 6 — Mirkhollow  *(Chapter 4)*

_The letters point into the Mirkhollow: spiders, druids who consider you trespass, wyverns, and a mine that is not on any map._

### Setting out

_One of the following, whoever is riding along:_

**DELPHINE**  `q6_forest`

> [calm] The Mirkhollow. Old wood — older than the Wardens, older than the Gate. It's got its own druids, and they ain't friends of ours; we keep the balance by law and they keep it by blood.
>
> [quiet] Keep to the deer paths. Anything down here that looks like a road was made by something with a great many legs.
>

**HIWOT**  `q6_forest`

> [low] Old trees. Very old, very big. Things in the branches that stop moving when we look.
>
> [a breath] I will go first. No. I will not. You go first.
>

### Scene 1: The nest

*The nest: white web thick as sailcloth between the trunks, and a man hanging in it upside down, apparently at his ease.*

**KAITO**  `q6_web`

> [cheerful, from above] Ah — hello. Yes. Up here. In the web. It is exactly as embarrassing as it looks, and I apologise for it.
>
> [appraising] Not bounty hunters; you walk too close together. A green sash — Wardens, then, or with Wardens. Good. Wardens cut people down for nothing. Kaito. I hunt bounties, mostly, and I was hunting a wyvern's head when the spiders took offence.
>

> **What do you say?**
> 1. "Who pays a bounty on a wyvern?" — _question — the choice returns_
> 2. "Wardens cut for nothing. I am not a Warden. What is your debt worth?" — _question — the choice returns; Kaito +1_
> 3. "Hold still." — _Kaito +1; Kaito joins; sets faelenRecruited_
> 4. "Spiders have to eat too." — _blood +1; sets faelenLeft_

**KAITO** *(reply to 1)*  `q6_faelen_wyvern`

>

**KAITO** *(reply to 2)*  `q6_faelen_price`

> [delighted] Ah. Now we are talking properly. My bow, until your road ends. And a thing I saw, which I think you will want: east of here, past the wyvern cliffs, there is a mine under the hill. Men in iron livery go in at dawn and men in chains come out at dusk. I did not go closer. I hunt beasts. That did not look like a beast.
>

**KAITO** *(reply to 3)*  `q6_faelen_cut`

> [relieved] You are my favourite person. I say that to everyone. This once, forgive me, I mean it.
>
> [smiling] I will come along, if you will have me. The wyverns are that way, and so, I suspect, is whatever you came into these woods to find.
>

**KAITO** *(reply to 4)*  `q6_faelen_leave`

> [calling after you] Fair enough! If you change your mind, I will be — well. Here.

### Scene 2: The druid grove

*A ring of standing stones in a clearing. A woman in bark and hide steps out of nothing and puts a staff across the path.*

**WANJIRU**  `q6_grove`

> [fierce] Far enough. This wood is not a road, and you are not welcome on it. The Umbra hold this grove, and the Umbra say turn around. Eh?
>
> [sniffing] You carry iron from the Gate. The wood smells it on you. Which of you is theirs?
>

_(if Delphine in company)_

**DELPHINE**  `q6_grove_selene`

### Scene 4: The mine gate

_(if Delphine in company)_

**DELPHINE**  `q6_gate`

> [calm] Iron livery on the guards. Consortium men. And the tall one — Kestrel. A sword for hire who'll guard anything for anybody. I've crossed him before.

_(if Delphine recruited, Delphine alive)_

**DELPHINE**  `q6_fire`

> [quiet] Sit a minute. The forest's loud tonight and I want to say a thing before I lose the nerve.
>
> [soft] Tesfaye wrote to us every year about you. Twenty letters. I feel like I've known you since you could walk, and I met you a month ago. It's a strange thing. It ain't an unwelcome one.

> **What do you say?**
> 1. "What did he write?" — _question — the choice returns_
> 2. "He wrote to me about you, too. Not twenty letters. But enough." — _Delphine +2_
> 3. "You should sleep. It is a long walk to the mine."

>

**DELPHINE** *(reply to 1)*  `q6_fire_letters`

> [fond] The first year, that you'd learned to walk and walked straight into the library. The seventh, that you'd stolen honey from the brothers and let a cat take the blame. The last — that you were ready, and that he wasn't.

**DELPHINE** *(reply to 2)*  `q6_fire_warm`

## Quest 7 — The Iron Mine  *(Chapter 4)*

_The Consortium's secret mine, worked by slaves under a mage named Olamide. There is a valve at the bottom that can drown all of it._

### Setting out

_(if Beau in company)_

**BEAU**  `q7_gate`

> [grim] Slaves. They're w-working slaves in there. I can hear the chains from here.
>
> [steady] I'm going to the bottom for 'em, {target}. Whatever else we do today. Tell me you're with me.
>

> **What do you say?**
> 1. "We are with you. Everyone comes out." — _Beau +2; Delphine +1_
> 2. "The mage first. Then the slaves, if there is time." — _Beau -1_
>

**BEAU** *(reply to 1)*  `q7_dorran_with`

**BEAU** *(reply to 2)*  `q7_dorran_mission`

### Scene 1: The upper works

_(combat, no dialogue)_

### Scene 2: The cages

_(if Hiwot in company)_

**HIWOT**  `q7_cages`

> [sick] They keep them in cages between shifts. Like dogs. Worse than dogs; I have seen dogs kept better than this.
>

### Scene 3: The third level

*A cage of iron bars at the end of the second level. The dwarf inside has been waiting in the dark long enough to be polite about it.*

**DAI MORGAN**  `q7_cage`

> [gravelly, Welsh] Well now. Either you're the new drivers or the old ones are dead. Which is it, then? — No, don't tell me; you're too muddy for drivers, and they'd have shot me by now.
>
> [hopeful] Dai Morgan. Priest of the deep places, and the last of the clan that cut this mine before the Consortium took it with paper and knives. I know every valve in it — including the one at the bottom that lets the river in.
>

_(if Beau in company)_

**BEAU**  `q7_cage_beau`

> [urgent] The ch-chain-gang. Where do they keep them between shifts?
>

_(if Beau in company)_

**DAI MORGAN**  `q7_cage_beau_reply`

> [grim] Bottom level, by the valve room, so the drivers can drown them if the mine's ever taken. Mind that, shield-man. Whoever turns that wheel turns it on them.
>

> **What do you say?**
> 1. "Paper and knives? How does a trading house take a dwarven mine?" — _question — the choice returns_
> 2. "The old ones are dead. Get up; you are with us." — _Dai Morgan +2; Dai Morgan joins; sets durnikFreed_
> 3. "Stay where you are. We will come back for you." — _blood +1; sets durnikLeft_
>

**DAI MORGAN** *(reply to 1)*  `q7_durnik_paper`

> [grim] A debt we didn't owe, bought off a man who didn't own it, and enforced by men with swords while the magistrate looked at the ceiling. My cousins argued. My cousins are on the lowest level now, and they don't argue anymore.
>

**DAI MORGAN** *(reply to 2)*  `q7_durnik_free`

> [grunting to his feet] With you. Aye. There's lovely. Mind the third level; the mage keeps his study there, and he doesn't care for knocking.

### Scene 4: Olamide's study

*A study cut into the rock, warm and dry, with shelves of ledgers. A man in a good coat does not look up from his writing.*

**OLAMIDE**  `q7_study`

> [irritated] You have tracked mud across the ledgers. Do you know how long a clean ledger takes?
>
> [cold] Guards. The Consortium has paid for this mine three times over, and it will not pay a fourth time for the likes of you.

_(if Dai Morgan in company)_

**DAI MORGAN**  `q7_study_dai`

> [very level] Morgan. Bryn and Gareth Morgan. My cousins. Which ledger are they in, mage?
>

_(if Dai Morgan in company)_

**OLAMIDE**  `q7_study_dai_reply`

> [without looking up] Ledger four. The deceased column, I should think; the deep levels take the dwarves first. Guards!

_(if Dai Morgan in company)_

**DAI MORGAN**  `q7_study_dai_after`

> [quiet] ...Then I'll be having ledger four. Go on, {target}.
>

> **What do you say?**

>

**OLAMIDE** *(reply to 1)*  `q7_malvane_who`

_(if Winston in company, Dai Morgan not in company)_

**WINSTON**  `q7_study_winston`

_(if Winston in company, Dai Morgan not in company)_

### Scene 5: The valve room

_(if flag durnikFreed, Beau in company)_

**DAI MORGAN**  `q7_valve`

> [urgent] The valve room. Turn the great wheel and the river takes the bottom two levels in the time it takes to say a prayer.

_(if Beau in company)_

_One of the following, whoever is riding along:_

**DELPHINE**  `q7_valve`

> [tight] Beau's still down there. {target}. Beau is still down there.
>

**HIWOT**  `q7_valve`

> [frantic] Beau is below with the chain-gang. If you turn that wheel he drowns with them.
>

> **What do you say?**
> 1. "Turn the wheel. Now." — _no fight; blood +1; Delphine -3; Dai Morgan -1; Hiwot -1; Beau dies; sets floodedEarly_

### After the last fight

_(if flag waitedForDorran)_

**BEAU**  `q7_after`

_(if not floodedEarly)_

_One of the following, whoever is riding along:_

**DELPHINE**  `q7_papers`

> [reading] Olamide wrote to three men at the Consortium's tower in Varenholm's Gate. Adigun Adeyinka. Bankole. Rotimi.
>
> [calm] Adeyinka. Cal heard right. The bandits are broke and the mine's drowned, and the road north is open, and so, at last, are the names.
>

**HIWOT**  `q7_papers`

> [reading] Three names at the Consortium's tower in the city. Adigun Adeyinka, Bankole, Rotimi.

### Back in town

_(if not umbralBetrayed, Desmond recruited)_

**DESMOND**  `q7_papers`

_(if not umbralBetrayed, Winston recruited)_

**WINSTON**  `q7_papers`

**WINSTON** *(reply to 1)*  `q7_papers_who`

> [level] The Umbral Hand. You have heard the name; everybody has, and everybody pretends they haven't. Merchants, mostly, of a kind. They want to know who is cornering iron on this coast, and why, and they don't much care who dies of the knowing.

**WINSTON** *(reply to 2)*  `q7_papers_give`

## Quest 8 — Varenholm's Gate  *(Chapter 5)*

_Serpent's Span, the checkpoint, and the city at last. A Burning Gauntlet officer wants something in the sewers dead and a trading house looked at._

### Setting out

*Serpent's Span: a bridge of black stone, a checkpoint, and behind it the towers of Varenholm's Gate. An officer with a burn-scarred jaw is reading your papers.*

**EMEKA OBI**  `q8_span`

> [gruff] Serpent's Span. Papers. — Ah. You are the company from the south. The one that drowned the Consortium's mine; half the city has heard it, the Consortium made sure of that when they went crying to the Council.
>
> [plain] Emeka Obi, Burning Gauntlet. One question before anything, and I want a number, not a story. The Consortium told the Council there were no slaves in that mine. How many did you see in chains?
>

> **What do you say?**
> 1. "Nineteen. I counted them out." — _if flag waitedForDorran · sets toldNineteen_
> 2. "Cages of them. I did not count."
> 3. "That is between me and the Duke."
>

**EMEKA OBI** *(reply to 1)*  `q8_count_nineteen`

> [writing] Nineteen. Good. A number a man can read aloud to a room of merchants. I will remember it when they tell me again that there were none.
>

**EMEKA OBI** *(reply to 2)*  `q8_count_many`

> [grunting] Cages. Ah-ah. "Cages" is a word the Council can argue with; a number they cannot. Next time, count. — It is not a small thing, what you did down there. I will say that once.
>

**EMEKA OBI** *(reply to 3)*  `q8_count_none`

> [flat] Between you and the Duke. Very well. The Duke will ask the same question, and he does not like "between" any more than I do.
>

**EMEKA OBI**  `q8_jobs`

> [plain] Duke Adebayo wants a word with you, but first I want two things done, and I would rather they were done by people the Consortium already hates. One: something under the docks is eating dock-workers, and the sewer-men will not go down. Two: the Nine Lanterns trading house has stopped being the Nine Lanterns. Same faces, wrong people; I cannot explain it better than that, and I have tried.
>
> [flat] Do both. Then the Duke.
>

> **What do you say?**
> 1. "Why does the Duke want me? He does not know me." — _question — the choice returns_
> 2. "Consider it done." — _Santiago +1_
> 3. "The Gauntlet pays for this, I assume." — _Hiwot +1_
>

**EMEKA OBI** *(reply to 1)*  `q8_halloran_why`

> [quiet] Because the iron trouble has a name now, and the name is the Iron Consortium, and you are the only people alive who walked out of their mine with proof. He does not know you. He knows that. Do the jobs, my friend. Bring the proof.
>

**EMEKA OBI** *(reply to 2)*  `q8_halloran_yes`

> [approving] Good answer. The docks are that way. Hold your breath.
>

**EMEKA OBI** *(reply to 3)*  `q8_halloran_pay`

> [snorting] It pays. Not well. Nobody in this city pays well except the people you are fighting.
>

### Scene 1: The sewers

_(if Hiwot in company)_

**HIWOT**  `q8_sewers`

> [gagging] I have been in a mine, a fortress and a spider nest this month, and THIS is the worst. This is the worst place.
>

_(if Dai Morgan in company, Hiwot not in company)_

**DAI MORGAN**  `q8_sewers`

> [approving] Good stonework, mind. Dwarven, some of it, and old. Shame about the smell.
>

### Scene 2: The Nine Lanterns door

_One of the following, whoever is riding along:_

**KAITO**  `q8_door`

> [murmuring] Doorman. Big. Bored. I can talk us past him; bored men love a story, and I have several.
>

**HIWOT**  `q8_door`

> [whispering] Doorman. I can get us past him. He will not even remember we were here.
>

**WINSTON**  `q8_door`

> [flat] Doorman. Leave him to me. Everybody has a price, and his is written on his face.
>

> **What do you say?**
> 1. "Kaito. Talk." — _if Kaito in company · no fight; Kaito +1_
> 2. "Hiwot. Quietly." — _if Hiwot in company · no fight; Hiwot +1_
> 3. "Winston. Pay him." — _if Winston in company · no fight; gold -30_
> 4. "We go through him."
>

**KAITO** *(reply to 1)*  `q8_door_faelen`

> [pleased] — and that is how I lost the boot. He is still laughing. In, in, before he thinks about it.
>

**HIWOT** *(reply to 2)*  `q8_door_wren`

> [smug] Side window. He is asleep on his feet. I told you.
>

**WINSTON** *(reply to 3)*  `q8_door_fennick`

> [flat] Thirty gold and the man has gone for a very long lunch.
>

**KAITO** *(reply to 4, when Kaito is the one speaking)*  `q8_door_force`

> [resigned] Through him. Very well. I will apologise to him afterwards; it seems only polite.
>

**HIWOT** *(reply to 4, when Hiwot is the one speaking)*  `q8_door_force`

> [sighing] Loud again. I am keeping a list.
>

**WINSTON** *(reply to 4, when Winston is the one speaking)*  `q8_door_force`

> [dry] Through him, then. Mind — a man that size falls slow.
>

### Scene 3: The counting room

_(if Delphine in company)_

**DELPHINE**  `q8_faces`

> [disturbed] That's the merchant's face and it ain't the merchant. Look at the eyes, honey. Nothing lives behind 'em.
>
> [hard] Shape-thieves. They wear you after they kill you. Don't let one get behind you.
>

_(if Hiwot in company, Delphine not in company)_

**HIWOT**  `q8_faces`

> [horrified] That is the merchant's face. That is his FACE and it is not him. Nothing is behind the eyes.
>

### Scene 4: The upper office

_(combat, no dialogue)_

### Back in town

*The Ducal Palace. A tired man in a red coat sits at a table covered in maps and does not get up.*

**DUKE ADEBAYO**  `q8_duke`

> [weary] So. The company that drowned a mine. Obi says you are rude and effective. I have use for both.
>
> [precise] Before I say anything worth hearing: the papers you carried out of that mine. Who else has seen them? Every name. I do not enjoy surprises in Council.
>

> **What do you say?**
> 1. "My company, and now you."
> 2. "The Umbral Hand has copies. I allowed it." — _if flag umbralPapers_
> 3. "Wardens. Delphine of the Open Hand read them first." — _if Delphine recruited_
>

**DUKE ADEBAYO** *(reply to 1)*  `q8_seen_nobody`

> [a nod] Good. Keep it so. A paper nobody has read is worth twice one everybody has argued about.
>

**DUKE ADEBAYO** *(reply to 2)*  `q8_seen_hand`

> [a long breath] The Umbral Hand. Then the whole market will have read them by the week's end, and the Council will hear it from fishwives before it hears it from me. Ah-ah. — Fine. Faster than my clerks, at least. It is not a small thing you have done, and I am not yet sure whether it was a good one.
>

**DUKE ADEBAYO** *(reply to 3)*  `q8_seen_wardens`

> [dry] Wardens. Then they are honest and nobody in this city will believe them. Good. That is one problem I already know how to solve.
>

**DUKE ADEBAYO**  `q8_duke_work`

> [precise] The Iron Consortium has been strangling this city's iron for a year and blaming Calder for it. War with Calder would kill ten thousand people, and the Council votes on that war in a fortnight. I need their papers — the ones in their own tower, in their own hand — before the vote. It is not a small matter.
>

> **What do you say?**
> 1. "Then we will get them. For the city." — _Santiago +1; Delphine +1; leans gauntlet_
> 2. "For the city, and for a price." — _Hiwot +1; Kaito +1_
> 3. "The Consortium has been trying to kill me since Lanternhold. Why me, Duke?" — _sets askedHalvard_
>

**DUKE ADEBAYO** *(reply to 1)*  `q8_halvard_city`

> [nodding] Good. I will remember that when this is over. Dukes remember more than people think, my friend.
>

**DUKE ADEBAYO** *(reply to 2)*  `q8_halvard_pay`

> [dry] Five hundred on delivery. Obi will scowl. Ignore him; he scowls at me too.
>

**DUKE ADEBAYO** *(reply to 3)*  `q8_halvard_blood`

> [careful] I do not know, and I will not insult you with a guess. I know they were hunting Tesfaye's ward before they were hunting anyone else, and Tesfaye was a Warden who spent twenty years hiding something in a library.
>
> [quiet] Bring me the papers. Whatever they are hiding, it will be in them.

## Quest 9 — The Consortium Tower  *(Chapter 5)*

_Duke Adebayo wants the Iron Consortium's papers. You go in as a mercenary looking for work and come out with the top floor's secrets._

### Setting out

**DUKE ADEBAYO**  `q9_plan`

> [precise] The Consortium is hiring swords. You walk in the front door as swords. The ledgers are on the top floor with three men who never leave it.
>
> [dry] If you can do it without burning the tower down, the city would appreciate it. If you cannot, the city will understand.
>

### Scene 1: The lobby

_One of the following, whoever is riding along:_

**HIWOT**  `q9_lobby`

> [whispering] A clerk. Two guards. A very long list of names on his desk, and we are not on it.
>

**DELPHINE**  `q9_lobby`

> [murmuring] A clerk with a list and two guards who are paid to believe him.
>

**KAITO**  `q9_lobby`

> [murmuring] A clerk. A list. Two guards. Forgive me — I love a lobby.
>

**DAI MORGAN**  `q9_lobby`

> [gravelly] Clerk with a list. Two guards. Good stone, again. Shame.
>

> **What do you say?**
> 1. "We are the company from the south. Olamide sent for us before the mine flooded." — _if not umbralBetrayed · no fight; sets toweredQuiet_
> 2. "Guards first. The clerk if he runs." — _blood +1_
> 3. "Hiwot, go and see what is on that list." — _if Hiwot in company · no fight; Hiwot +1_
>

**HIWOT** *(reply to 1, when Hiwot is the one speaking)*  `q9_lobby_talk`

> [impressed] He BELIEVED you. Olamide's name still opens doors. Third floor, he says. Do not touch anything.
>

**DELPHINE** *(reply to 1, when Delphine is the one speaking)*  `q9_lobby_talk`

> [quiet] He believed it. Third floor. Don't touch anything.
>

**KAITO** *(reply to 1, when Kaito is the one speaking)*  `q9_lobby_talk`

> [smiling] He believed it. Third floor. Touch nothing, he says — as if.
>

**DAI MORGAN** *(reply to 1, when Dai Morgan is the one speaking)*  `q9_lobby_talk`

> [grunting] Third floor. Don't touch anything. Good advice for a tower, that.
>

**HIWOT** *(reply to 2, when Hiwot is the one speaking)*  `q9_lobby_fight`

> [flat] So much for quiet. Stairs. Go.
>

**DELPHINE** *(reply to 2, when Delphine is the one speaking)*  `q9_lobby_fight`

> [flat] Stairs, then.
>

**KAITO** *(reply to 2, when Kaito is the one speaking)*  `q9_lobby_fight`

> [cheerful] Stairs it is.
>

**DAI MORGAN** *(reply to 2, when Dai Morgan is the one speaking)*  `q9_lobby_fight`

> [grim] Stairs.
>

**HIWOT** *(reply to 3)*  `q9_lobby_wren`

> [hushed] Got it. There is a name at the bottom in red: "the ward — as agreed." Whatever we do up there, somebody upstairs already knows we are coming.

### Scene 3: Folake's floor

*A floor of silk hangings and one desk. The woman behind it has been expecting you, and has poured two cups.*

**FOLAKE**  `q9_floor`

> [silken] Put the swords down; you will not need them on my floor, and I have poured two cups. I am Folake. I keep Kolade Adeyinka's bed warm and the Consortium's secrets warmer.
>
> [pleasant] I have given you his name. Now tell me what happened on the Griffon Road. Before Tesfaye died, did Kolade offer him a bargain? He usually does. I want to know what he offered.
>

_(if Santiago in company)_

**SANTIAGO**  `q9_floor_cassian`

> [low] With respect. You do not have to answer her. She is bargaining.
>

_(if Layla in company)_

**LAYLA**  `q9_floor_ilvara`

> [low, amused] Answer her. She is the only person in this tower telling the truth, and she is doing it for money. I respect that.
>

**FOLAKE**  `q9_floor_wait`

> [patient, smiling] I can wait. I am very good at waiting; it is most of what I do up here.
>

> **What do you say?**
> 1. "His life and his library, in exchange for me." — _sets toldFolake_
> 2. "Nothing. He simply took."
> 3. "Tell me what you are selling first, and I will decide what it costs."
>

**FOLAKE** *(reply to 1)*  `q9_offer_library`

> [satisfied] His library. Not gold, not the child's life — the old man's books. Kolade knew what Tesfaye loved and offered him exactly that. That is how he does everything, my dear, and it is why he will win unless somebody who understands him is on the other side. Which brings us to business.
>

**FOLAKE** *(reply to 2)*  `q9_offer_nothing`

> [a small smile] A lie, and a loyal one. He offered. He always offers; it is the only thing about him I still find beautiful. Keep your lie; it tells me you loved the old man, which is also useful. Now, business.
>

**FOLAKE** *(reply to 3)*  `q9_offer_price`

> [delighted] Oh, good. Somebody taught you. — I am selling a way into the palace, and the truth about what you are, and I want his head and the Consortium afterward. That is the whole shop. Now you know the price; pay me the answer, or do not, and we go on to business either way.
>

**FOLAKE**  `q9_floor_business`

> [brisk, pleasant] Now. He is going to be a Grand Duke by month's end, and he is going to have you killed for it. I would rather the reverse. Shall we talk, my dear?
>

> **What do you say?**
> 1. "Kolade Adeyinka. Who is he to this city? Say it as if I had never heard the name." — _question — the choice returns_
> 2. "Talk. Quickly." — _Kaito +1; Layla +1; Santiago -1; sets lysandraBargain_
> 3. "You will talk to Duke Adebayo. In chains." — _Santiago +1; sets lysandraArrested_
> 4. "You share his bed. You share his end." — _blood +1; Delphine -1; Amara -1; sets lysandraDead_
>

**FOLAKE** *(reply to 1)*  `q9_lysandra_kolade`

> [precise] Adigun Adeyinka's foster-son, and the head of the Consortium in everything but the ledger. The man in the black armour on your road; he told me about the road himself, and he told it fondly. He collects people like you. He says you are family. He does not mean it kindly, and he does not mean it as a threat either, which is the frightening part.
>

**FOLAKE** *(reply to 2)*  `q9_lysandra_deal`

> [pleased] Kolade is not a merchant's son. He is something older, and he believes you are the same. He wants a war so that a great many people die at once; he believes that makes him a god, and his tutor believes it too, and the tutor is the clever one.
>
> [soft] When you need a way into the palace, come to me. I will have one. The price is his head, and the Consortium afterward — for me.
>

**FOLAKE** *(reply to 3)*  `q9_lysandra_arrest`

> [amused] Chains. How lawful. Fine. I will tell Adebayo everything and he will hang me for it, and Kolade will still be sworn in on time.
>
> [bitter] Go upstairs. The top floor is where he keeps the truth about you.
>

**FOLAKE** *(reply to 4)*  `q9_lysandra_kill`

> [whispering] He will feel this. That is the only thing I am sorry for.

### Scene 4: The top floor

_(combat, no dialogue)_

### After the last fight

_One of the following, whoever is riding along:_

**DELPHINE**  `q9_top`

> [reading] Adigun Adeyinka, Bankole, Rotimi. Gone to Lanternhold — to LANTERNHOLD — for a summit with the keepers.
>
> [cold] The three men behind all of this are sitting in the library you grew up in.
>

**HIWOT**  `q9_top`

> [stunned] Lanternhold. They went HOME. The three men who paid to kill Tesfaye are sitting in his library. — The drawer. Delphine, the locked drawer. We are going to be in that room.
>

### Back in town

**DUKE ADEBAYO**  `q9_book`

> [grave] Then you go to Lanternhold. The keep takes a book as its toll; here is one worth the toll. Do not lose it.
>
> [quiet] Find them. Bring me proof I can read to the Council. And {target} — whatever they are hiding about you, I would rather you heard it from a friend than from them.

> [quiet] I buried my husband three weeks ago, and I'm ashamed of what I'm fixing to say, so I'll say it fast.
>
> [steady] I ain't asking for anything. I'm telling you that when this is over, if you asked, I'd say yes. That's all. That's a great deal, for me, and it's more than I've got a right to.
>

> **What do you say?**
> 1. "(Delphine) Yes."
> 2. Say nothing.
>

**DELPHINE** *(if yes)*  `q9_romance_yes`

> [a soft, unsteady laugh] Then that's settled, and I'm going to sleep before I say anything foolish.
>
> [warm] Goodnight, sugar. Actually goodnight.
>

**DELPHINE** *(if not)*  `q9_romance_no`

> [gentle] Then it's said and it's done, and nothing between us changes. Sleep well.
>

**SANTIAGO**  `q9_romance`

> [stumbling] I have written this out four times and burned it three. I — {target}. With respect. I have not stopped looking at you since the wolves, and I am not the sort who looks.
>
> [earnest] If the Order asks, I will say it was duty. It was not.
>

> **What do you say?**
> 1. "(Santiago) Yes."
> 2. Say nothing.

**SANTIAGO** *(if yes)*  `q9_romance_yes`

**SANTIAGO** *(if not)*  `q9_romance_no`

> [bravely] Then I am glad I said it, and I will not say it again. Thank you for hearing it.
>

**ITSUKI**  `q9_romance`

> [low] I buried the last person I loved beside a road. I said I would not do this again.
>
> [quiet] I would, though. With you. I wanted you to know it before the city, in case the city is the end of me.
>

> **What do you say?**
> 1. "(Itsuki) Yes."
> 2. Say nothing.
>

**ITSUKI** *(if yes)*  `q9_romance_yes`

> [exhaling] Then I will try to live through the city. That is new. Thank you for giving me a reason.
>

**ITSUKI** *(if not)*  `q9_romance_no`

> [calm] I understand. It was enough to say it. Sleep.
>

**LAYLA**  `q9_romance`

> [dry] Do not look so alarmed. I am not asking you to love me; your people are terrible at it.
>
> [soft] I am telling you that I have decided to stay, and that when you sit in that chair I mean to be standing beside it. By the deep, make of that what you will.
>

> **What do you say?**
> 1. "(Layla) Yes."
> 2. Say nothing.
>

**LAYLA** *(if yes)*  `q9_romance_yes`

> [satisfied] Good. You will not regret it, and if you do, I will mend that.

**LAYLA** *(if not)*  `q9_romance_no`

> [shrugging] As you like. The offer keeps. I am patient in a way your kind is not.
>

**KAITO**  `q9_romance`

> [smiling] So. I flirt with everything. Trees. Wyverns. That doorman. You have noticed.
>
> [suddenly serious] Forgive me. I have not meant a word of it since the web. I mean this one. Tell me to stop, or tell me not to.
>

> **What do you say?**
> 1. "(Kaito) Yes."
> 2. Say nothing.

**KAITO** *(if yes)*  `q9_romance_yes`

**KAITO** *(if not)*  `q9_romance_no`

**AMARA**  `q9_romance`

> [quiet] I loved a man who wanted to be a god. I am not proud of it, and I am not sorry for it.
>
> [steady] I do not know what I want from you. I know that when you kept your word at the gate, something in me turned toward you the way a plant turns to a window. Say something, or do not.

> **What do you say?**
> 1. "(Amara) Yes."

## Quest 10 — Return to Lanternhold  *(Chapter 6)*

_The Consortium leaders have gone to the library you grew up in. Adebayo gives you a book to buy your way through the gate. Something is waiting inside that is not the Consortium._

### Setting out

*The hill road to Lanternhold. A quiet man in a plain coat is waiting at the milestone with something small in his hand.*

**SANNI**  `q10_ring`

> [quiet, city-formal] You are Tesfaye's ward. I knew him. Not well; well enough to be sorry.
>
> [calm] Take this ring. It was his once, before it was mine. And know this, my friend: the three men inside deserve whatever you decide to give them. Nobody will weep.
>

_(if Hiwot in company)_

**HIWOT**  `q10_ring_hiwot`

> [suspicious] How did you know Tesfaye? I lived in that keep twenty years and I never once saw you.
>

_(if Hiwot in company)_

**SANNI**  `q10_ring_hiwot_reply`

> [a warm, easy smile] The way one knows a rumour, young lady. From a distance, and better than the rumour would like.
>

_(if Hiwot in company)_

**HIWOT**  `q10_ring_hiwot_after`

> [flat] That is not an answer.
>

_(if Hiwot in company)_

**SANNI**  `q10_ring_hiwot_end`

> [pleasantly] No. It is not. — The ring, {target}. Take it or do not; I have a long walk either way.
>

> **What do you say?**
> 1. "...Thank you. Who are you?" — _sets sarnRing_
> 2. "I do not take gifts from strangers on roads." — _Hiwot +1_
> 3. "If this is a trick, I will find you." — _blood +1; sets sarnRing_
>

**SANNI** *(reply to 1)*  `q10_sarn_take`

> [soft] Sanni. Nobody. Wear it inside; the keepers will know it. Go well.
>

**SANNI** *(reply to 2)*  `q10_sarn_refuse`

> [amused] Wise. Tesfaye taught you that. Go well anyway.
>

**SANNI** *(reply to 3)*  `q10_sarn_threat`

> [pleased] I believe you would. Go well, {target}.

### Scene 1: The reading rooms

**ABBA GEBRE**  `q10_gate`

> [cold] A book buys you the door. It does not buy you my good opinion.
>
> [stiff] Where did he die? On what road, and on what night? The keep's book of the dead wants a road and a night, and nobody has given me either.
>

> **What do you say?**
> 1. "The Griffon Road, the night we left. He stood between me and the man who killed him."
> 2. "Write "on the road." It is all you need."
>

**ABBA GEBRE** *(reply to 1)*  `q10_where_road`

> [writing, not looking up] "The Griffon Road. Standing." — Tesfaye left this keep with you and came back to it as a line in my book. Do not make a habit of it.
>

**ABBA GEBRE** *(reply to 2)*  `q10_where_refuse`

> [cold] "On the road." Very well. It is what he would have wanted written; he never cared for particulars. Do not make a habit of this, child.
>

**DAWIT**  `q10_gate`

> [kind] Pay him no mind. He mourns like a wall. — Come and find me in the upper reading room before you do anything else, my child. Tesfaye left something with me. For you. For now.
>

_(if Hiwot in company)_

**HIWOT**  `q10_home`

> [strange] It smells the same. Ink and dust and the brothers' lentils. I thought it would feel like home, and it feels like a trap.
>

### Scene 2: The summit

*The great reading room. Three men in city coats look up from a table of maps.*

**ADIGUN ADEYINKA**  `q10_summit`

> [startled] Guards — no. No, hold. I know who you are.
>
> [shaking] Adigun Adeyinka. I run the Consortium's Gate office. I did not order Tesfaye killed. I did not order YOU killed. That was — ah-ah, that was my son. My foster-son. He does not answer to me anymore.
>

_(if Delphine in company)_

**DELPHINE**  `q10_summit_selene`

> [flat] Then answer me this, Adeyinka, before anybody decides anything. The iron hand in red wax on the ore wagons. Whose seal is that?
>

_(if Delphine in company)_

**ADIGUN ADEYINKA**  `q10_summit_selene_reply`

> [miserable] Mine. The house's. — He took it off my desk in the spring, and my couriers with it, and I have been signing for a man who no longer asks me.
>

_(if Delphine in company)_

**DELPHINE**  `q10_summit_selene_after`

> [to you, quiet] Your seal on the wagons and his on the bounty. Same wax. I've been right since the inn, honey, and I ain't glad of it.
>

**BANKOLE**  `q10_summit`

> [bluster] Kill them, Adigun, they have swords in a LIBRARY —
>

> **What do you say?**
> 1. "Three names on a letter. Three men in a room. Easy arithmetic." — _blood +1; Santiago -1; Delphine -1; Layla +1; sets leadersKilled_
> 2. "Your son. Say his name." — _no fight; sets leadersSpared_
> 3. "You will answer to Adebayo. All three of you. Nobody dies in a library." — _no fight; blood -1; Santiago +1; sets leadersSpared; sets leadersArrested_
>

**ADIGUN ADEYINKA** *(reply to 1)*  `q10_summit_kill`

> [terrified] He will not stop when we are dead. He will not STOP —
>

**ADIGUN ADEYINKA** *(reply to 2)*  `q10_summit_talk`

> [whispering] Kolade. Kolade Adeyinka. I found him in a gutter and I raised him to count money, and he has been counting something else since a tutor filled his head with prophecies.
>
> [broken] He is in this keep tonight. I do not know what face he is wearing.
>

**ADIGUN ADEYINKA** *(reply to 3)*  `q10_summit_arrest`

> [relieved] Yes. Yes. Adebayo. Anything. Take us out of here before he —
>

### Scene 3: The catacombs

*The upper reading room. Dawit has a sealed letter under his hand. The wax is twenty years old.*

**DAWIT**  `q10_letter`

> [gently] Sit. I have Tesfaye's letter here. Before you read it... did he say anything at the end? I need to know.
>

> **What do you say?**
> 1. "That he had been proud of me every day since he carried me through the gate."
> 2. "Only "run." And two names."
> 3. "I did not hear. I was doing as I was told."
>

**DAWIT** *(reply to 1)*  `q10_end_proud`

> [closing his eyes] Then he managed it. He practised that sentence on me for a year, my child, and never once got through it without stopping. — Here. Read it. I will stay.
>

**DAWIT** *(reply to 2)*  `q10_end_run`

> [softly] "Run." Yes. He was a practical man to the last breath. He wrote the rest down, so that he would not have to trust the last breath to carry it. — Here. Read it. I will stay.
>

**DAWIT** *(reply to 3)*  `q10_end_nothing`

> [gently] Then you did the only thing he asked, and it is the reason I can give you this at all. — Here. Read it. I will stay.
>

**DAWIT**  `q10_letter_give`

> [quiet] Tesfaye wrote it the year he brought you here. He made me swear to give it to you only when someone had already tried to tell you the wrong way.
>

*You read it twice. Then you read the last line a third time.*

**TESFAYE**  `q10_letter`

> [echoing, read aloud] "If you are reading this, my child, I failed to tell you myself, and I am sorry. Your mother was one of many. Your father was Morrak, the god of murder, in the last year before he died — and he sired children so that one of them might one day take his place. You are one. So is the man who killed me. He is your brother. He believes the throne is his. It is not, unless you decide it is."
>

> **What do you say?**
> 1. "He raised a monster and loved it anyway." — _blood -1; Delphine +1; Hiwot +1; sets letter_
> 2. "Twenty years and he never said a word. He should have told me." — _Hiwot -1; sets letter_
> 3. "A throne. And a brother sitting in my seat." — _blood +1; sets letter_
>

**DAWIT** *(reply to 1)*  `q10_letter_grief`

> [soft] He raised a child. What the child became was always going to be the child's own work. He knew that. He hoped.
>

**DAWIT** *(reply to 2)*  `q10_letter_anger`

> [sad] He tried, every year. He wrote it out and burned it. He thought one more year of not knowing was one more year of you being only his.
>

**DAWIT** *(reply to 3)*  `q10_letter_hunger`

> [frightened] Do not — {target}. He wrote the last line for exactly that look on your face. Read it again.
>

_(if flag leadersKilled)_

>

_(if flag leadersSpared)_

**ABBA GEBRE**  `q10_arrest_spared`

> [thundering] Three men are dead in my reading room — found at midnight, throats opened — and this company was the last to speak with them. Take them. Take all of them.
>

**DAWIT**  `q10_escape`

> [urgent] The catacombs. There is a way to the shore under the old tombs. Gebre does not know it; Tesfaye did. Go, and do not trust any face you meet down there. Not even mine.
>

**GBENGA**  `q10_catacombs`

> [bored] Down here, then. Good. Fewer witnesses and no keepers.
>
> [professional] Gbenga. Your brother sends his regards and would like this finished before breakfast. — Which of you is the ward? I was given a face, not a name, and it is dark.
>

_(if Layla in company)_

## Quest 11 — The Hunted City  *(Chapter 7)*

_Wanted posters carry your face. Emeka Obi is dead, Segun Marr commands the Gauntlet, and Duke Adebayo is dying under the care of a physician who is not a physician._

### Setting out

*The Gate, at dawn. Your face is nailed to every post on the street.*

_One of the following, whoever is riding along:_

**HIWOT**  `q11_posters`

> [reading] "Wanted, for the murder of Grand Duke Ayodele and of the Consortium summit at Lanternhold: the ward of Tesfaye, and company." That is your face. That is a BAD drawing of your face.
>
> [quiet] The street is full of it: Emeka Obi is dead. A man called Segun Marr commands the Gauntlet now, and he is the one who signed this.
>

**DELPHINE**  `q11_posters`

> [cold] Grand Duke Ayodele was murdered last night and they've put your name on it. Obi's dead too. A man called Segun Marr runs the Gauntlet now.
>
> [calm] Kolade will be sworn in as the new Duke within days. He's moved everything into place while we were underground.
>

_One of the following, whoever is riding along:_

**DELPHINE**  `q11_doors`

> [calm] Three ways into that palace, and we won't get a second try.
>
> [measured] Adebayo's dying; cure him and the Gauntlet is ours. Folake offered a way in, for a price. And the thieves under the Undervault will sell us a door if we owe 'em after.
>

**HIWOT**  `q11_doors`

> [thinking] Three doors. Adebayo, if we can save him. Folake, if you can stand her. Or Tunde Softfoot and a debt.
>

> **What do you say?**
> 1. "We find Adebayo and we save him. We do this lawfully." — _Santiago +2; Delphine +1; Kaito -1; allegiance: gauntlet_
> 2. "Folake. Kolade's head for her Consortium. I can live with that." — _if flag lysandraBargain · blood +1; Layla +1; Santiago -2; allegiance: consortium_
> 3. "The thieves. A debt is cheaper than a Duke." — _Kaito +2; Hiwot +1; Santiago -1; allegiance: thieves_
>

**DELPHINE** *(reply to 1, when Delphine is the one speaking)*  `q11_alleg_gauntlet`

> [approving] Lawfully. Tesfaye would've said the same, and then he'd have cheated a little. Let's go find the Duke.
>

**HIWOT** *(reply to 1, when Hiwot is the one speaking)*  `q11_alleg_gauntlet`

> [nodding] The Duke. All right. I like a Duke who owes us.
>

**DELPHINE** *(reply to 2, when Delphine is the one speaking)*  `q11_alleg_consortium`

> [flat] Her. Fine. I'll hold my nose. Don't you let her hold anything of yours.
>

**HIWOT** *(reply to 2, when Hiwot is the one speaking)*  `q11_alleg_consortium`

> [uneasy] Folake. I do not trust her smile. I do not trust anything about her. But she does have a door.
>

**DELPHINE** *(reply to 3, when Delphine is the one speaking)*  `q11_alleg_thieves`

> [dry] Tunde Softfoot never forgets a debt. Neither will you. All right — the Undervault.
>

**HIWOT** *(reply to 3, when Hiwot is the one speaking)*  `q11_alleg_thieves`

> [grinning] Tunde! Yes. I was hoping you would say that. Thieves are honest about what they are.
>

### Scene 1: The patrol

_(combat, no dialogue)_

### Scene 2: Adebayo's sick-room

*The Duke's sick-room. A man in a physician's coat stands between you and the bed with a cup in his hand.*

**IDRIS**  `q11_healer`

> [oily] The Duke is resting. He must not be disturbed. I am his physician, and I will thank you to —
>
> [dropping the voice] — ah. You. The face on the posters. How very tiresome.
>

### Scene 3: The docks

*The docks, at dusk. A woman with two swords across her back is waiting at the end of the pier, alone.*

**AMARA**  `q11_docks`

> [steady] Put the swords away. If I wanted you dead I would have done it from the rooftop.
>
> [grave] I am Amara. I love Kolade Adeyinka. I also helped him kill the man who raised you. I know what that makes me to you. But I need you to hear me. Have you ever loved someone even after you knew what they'd done?
>

> **What do you say?**
> 1. "Yes." — _Amara +1_
> 2. "I loved a man who lied to me for twenty years. Does that count?"
> 3. "No. And I do not intend to start."
>

**AMARA** *(reply to 1)*  `q11_loved_yes`

> [a slow nod] Then you know the shape of it. Good. I will not have to explain the rest, only ask it.
>

**AMARA** *(reply to 2)*  `q11_loved_tesfaye`

> [quiet] He lied to keep you. Kolade has never lied to anyone in his life; it is not the same thing, and I think you know it. But yes. It counts. It means you can hear me.
>

**AMARA** *(reply to 3)*  `q11_loved_no`

> [level] Then you will think what I ask is weakness. Hear it anyway; you may need it later, when you are older and less certain.
>

_(if Itsuki in company)_

**ITSUKI**  `q11_docks_ithrel`

> [very quiet] The north road. A year ago. Were you there when the wagons burned?
>

_(if Itsuki in company)_

**AMARA**  `q11_docks_ithrel_reply`

> [without flinching] No. I was not. But I did not stop him sending Gorruk north, and I could have. Put that on my account with the rest, ranger. I will not argue the sum.
>

**AMARA**  `q11_docks_ask`

> [grave] Here is what I ask. Stop him. Not kill him. Stop him. There is a difference, and it matters to me more than my own life.
>

> **What do you say?**
> 1. "How does one stop a man like that without killing him?" — _question — the choice returns_
> 2. "If it can be done without killing him, I will do it that way. You have my word." — _no fight; blood -1; Amara +3; Itsuki -1; sets promisedAmara_
> 3. "He killed Tesfaye. He dies." — _no fight; Amara -2; Itsuki +1_

>

**AMARA** *(reply to 1)*  `q11_amara_how`

> [exact] Chains, and a cell, and the Council's law. He is not a god yet. He bleeds, he tires, he can be beaten to his knees; I have seen it done, once, in the fire temple where we met. On his knees he can be bound. It is not a small thing I ask. I know that.
>

**AMARA** *(reply to 2)*  `q11_amara_promise`

> [exhaling] Thank you. I did not expect that.
>
> [quiet] The coronation is in three nights. Two people called Rasheed and Kemi hold the invitations in the Undervault. Take them from them; they will not give them up.
>

**AMARA** *(reply to 3)*  `q11_amara_refuse`

> [cold] Then we will meet at the gate of the Undercity, and one of us will not walk past the other.

### Scene 4: The Undervault

**RASHEED**  `q11_undervault`

> [grinning] Kemi. Kemi, look. It is the poster. In person! Ah-ah — do we get the reward if we kill it ourselves?
>

**KEMI**  `q11_undervault`

> [bored] The reward is a thousand and the invitations are worth more. Stop talking and start bleeding them.

### After the last fight

_(if allegiance gauntlet)_

**DUKE ADEBAYO**  `q11_cured`

> [weak] Poison. Slow. He was — the physician was — I could not make my mouth work to say it.

> [rallying] Kolade. It was always Kolade. Get me to my own guard and I will get you into that coronation.
>

### Back in town

_(if allegiance gauntlet)_

**DUKE ADEBAYO**  `q11_way`

> [stronger] Two invitations and a Duke who owes you his life. Olumide will hold the doors. Folasade will hold the Council. You hold the evidence.
>
> [grave] He will not go quietly. He will run for the Undercity. When he does, do not let him reach the altar first.
>

_(if allegiance thieves)_

**TUNDE SOFTFOOT**  `q11_way`

> [soft] Two invitations, and a debt to the Undervault that you will pay when I say. Fair?
>
> [softer] Fair. Here is what nobody told you, my friend: under the palace is the old city. Under the old city is a temple. He is going there when it falls apart. So are you.
>

_(if allegiance consortium)_

**FOLAKE**  `q11_way`

> [silken] Two invitations and a bargain kept. His head; my Consortium. I will have a carriage at the palace steps.
>
> [cool] When it goes wrong — and it will — he will run for the Undercity. I will show you the way down. Nobody else knows it but Amara.

## Quest 12 — The Coronation  *(Chapter 7)*

_Kolade will be sworn in as Grand Duke tonight and declare war on Calder by morning. You have an invitation, the evidence, and a company in borrowed clothes._

### Setting out

*The palace steps, at night. Every window is lit.*

_One of the following, whoever is riding along:_

**DELPHINE**  `q12_steps`

> [low] Borrowed silks, real steel, two invitations. Everybody in that hall is either a guest or a shape-thief, and there's no way to tell which till the knives come out.
>
> [calm] Stay near the dukes. He needs them dead more than he needs you.
>

**HIWOT**  `q12_steps`

> [itching] I hate silk. I hate silk SO much. — There he is. On the dais. Smiling. He has a lovely smile. I want to put it through a wall.
>

### Scene 1: The great hall

*The great hall. Halfway through the oath, the guests nearest the dukes draw knives.*

**DUKE OLUMIDE**  `q12_hall`

> [booming] Blades! Blades in the hall! Folasade — Folasade, to me —
>

> **What do you say?**
> 1. "Olumide first. He is the one with the sword." — _sets protectedOrlan; sets dukeDead_
> 2. "Folasade first. She is the one who will believe us." — _sets protectedMira_
> 3. "Neither. Kolade. Now, while he is on the dais." — _blood +1; sets wentForKorvath; sets dukeDead; sets bothDukesDead_
>

**DUKE OLUMIDE** *(reply to 1)*  `q12_dukes_orlan`

> [roaring] HA! With me, then! Folasade — Folasade, get BEHIND something!
>

**DUKE FOLASADE** *(reply to 2)*  `q12_dukes_mira`

> [sharp] Good. Keep them off me and I will keep the Council listening. That is the only thing that matters in this room.
>

**DELPHINE** *(reply to 3, when Delphine is the one speaking)*  `q12_dukes_korvath`

> [shouting] The dukes are DYING, {target} — we can't hold both if you run at him —
>

**HIWOT** *(reply to 3, when Hiwot is the one speaking)*  `q12_dukes_korvath`

> [shouting] The dukes — {target}, the DUKES — we cannot hold them if you run at him —
>

### Scene 2: The dais

*The armoured giant from the Griffon Road pulls off the face of a Grand Duke's guest. Under it is a man who looks like you.*

**KOLADE ADEYINKA**  `q12_reveal`

> [calm, pleasant, to the hall] Enough. Put it down, all of you; nobody in this room is going to be paid tonight, and I would rather not lose good people to bad timing.
>
> [warm, to you] There you are. I have wanted to hear my brother's voice — my sister's — for a year, and I have only ever had it second-hand, from frightened men. Say something. The hall can wait; it is mostly dead.
>

> **What do you say?**
> 1. "Olamide's ledgers. Adigun's confession. Folake's letters. Every duke here can read." — _Santiago +1; Delphine +1_
> 2. "You killed the only father either of us ever had." — _blood -1; Hiwot +1_
> 3. "You are sitting in my seat, brother." — _blood +1; Layla +1; Santiago -1_
>

**KOLADE ADEYINKA** *(reply to 1)*  `q12_face_evidence`

> [delighted] Paper! Tesfaye's child brings paper to a coronation. That is the most charming thing I have seen in a year, and I mean that; he taught you well.
>
> [gently] It does not matter. Look at their faces: the war is already in their mouths, and paper does not take words back out. Baba — take me down.
>

**KOLADE ADEYINKA** *(reply to 2)*  `q12_face_aldric`

> [quiet, honest] He was never mine. He chose you. He could have chosen both of us, and he chose you, and I have made my peace with it in a way I do not think you have.
>
> [courteous] Baba. Take me down.
>

**KOLADE ADEYINKA** *(reply to 3)*  `q12_face_throne`

> [a slow, real smile] THERE you are. I knew it. I said to Amara, I said, it will be in the child too, wait and see.
>
> [warm] Come and take it, then. Not here — this is a hall for merchants. Come to the altar and take it from me properly. Baba — take me down.
>

### Scene 3: Olusegun's rear-guard

*A ring of frost. He and his tutor are gone. The rear-guard is not.*

**BABA OLUSEGUN**  `q12_teleport`

### Back in town

_(if not dukeDead)_

> [shaken] The Council has read it. The vote on the war is dead, and so is his claim.

_(if flag dukeDead, not bothDukesDead)_

**DUKE OLUMIDE**  `q12_council`

> [wheezing] Folasade is dead. He put a knife in her while the whole hall watched.

_(if flag bothDukesDead, allegiance gauntlet)_

**DUKE ADEBAYO**  `q12_council_dead`

> [hoarse, from a chair] Two Grand Dukes dead in their own hall, and the Council is me and a room full of ghosts. It is not a small thing you did, running at him.
>
> [hard] The vote is dead with them; nobody will vote for his war now. Go down and finish it. I will hold what is left.
>

_(if flag bothDukesDead, allegiance thieves)_

**TUNDE SOFTFOOT**  `q12_council_dead`

> [soft] Two dead dukes and a hall full of witnesses. The Undervault will take you down; the Gauntlet is too busy counting bodies.

> [softer] The debt grows, {target}. It always does.
>

_(if flag bothDukesDead, allegiance consortium)_

**FOLAKE**  `q12_council_dead`

## Quest 13 — The Undercity  *(Chapter 7)*

_Under the thieves' maze is an older city, and under that is a temple. Kolade's people are between you and it. So is the one who loves him._

### Setting out

_(if flag wrenHurt)_

**HIWOT**  `q13_return`

_Hiwot joins the company._

### Scene 1: The thieves' maze

_One of the following, whoever is riding along:_

**KAITO**  `q13_maze`

> [hushed] The thieves' maze. Every third flagstone is a trap and every fourth is a thief. I know the path; follow my feet exactly, please.
>

**HIWOT**  `q13_maze`

> [hushed] The thieves' maze. I can read it — half of it is Lanternhold locks, the cheap kind. Follow me exactly.
>

> **What do you say?**
> 1. "Lead." — _no fight; Kaito +1; Hiwot +1_
> 2. "No time. Straight through." — _blood +1_

**HIWOT** *(reply to 1, when Hiwot is the one speaking)*  `q13_maze_follow`

> [murmuring] Left. Again. Not that one. — Through. Nobody bled. Tell Tesfaye I was paying attention.
>

**KAITO** *(reply to 2, when Kaito is the one speaking)*  `q13_maze_cut`

> [sighing] Straight through. Watch the flagstones, then, and try to bleed on the thieves and not on me.

**HIWOT** *(reply to 2, when Hiwot is the one speaking)*  `q13_maze_cut`

> [groaning] Straight through. Fine. The loud list is getting long.

### Scene 3: The buried street

*A buried street, lit by torches that should have gone out a thousand years ago.*

**JELANI**  `q13_street`

> [sneering] The brother. Or the sister. It does not matter which — Kolade says the blood is the same, and the blood is what burns.

### Scene 5: The temple steps

*The temple steps. A Gauntlet officer in a new cloak stands at the top with the men he sold.*

**SEGUN MARR**  `q13_steps`

> [sneering] The Gauntlet stands with the new Duke. Whatever is left of the Council can argue about it afterwards.

**KAITO**  `q9_romance`

## Quest 14 — The Temple of Morrak  *(Chapter 7)*

_The last room. Your brother is waiting at the altar of a dead god, and he is glad you came._

### Setting out

*The Temple of Morrak. The stairs end in a hall of black stone, and the braziers are lit.*

_One of the following, whoever is riding along:_

**DELPHINE**  `q14_sanctum`

> [low] A temple to a dead god, still swept, still lit. Somebody's been praying here for twenty years.
>
> [steady] Whatever he says at that altar, {target}, you remember who raised you. Then you do what you have to.
>

**HIWOT**  `q14_sanctum`

> [whispering] It is warm down here. It should not be warm.
>
> [fierce] Whatever he says in there — you are Tesfaye's. Not his. Tesfaye's.
>

**LAYLA**  `q14_sanctum`

> [reverent] Do you feel it? The stone remembers him. Morrak. By the deep — it would remember you too, if you let it.
>

### Scene 1: The outer sanctum

_(combat, no dialogue)_

### Scene 2: The hall of mirrors

_One of the following, whoever is riding along:_

**HIWOT**  `q14_mirrors`

> [horrified] That is ME. That is all of us. They are wearing US.
>

**DELPHINE**  `q14_mirrors`

> [cold] Our faces. Every one. Kill 'em quick; don't look at the eyes.
>

### Scene 3: The altar

*The altar is a throne of black stone. Your brother sits in it with his helmet in his lap.*

**KOLADE ADEYINKA**  `q14_altar`

> [warm] You came. I hoped you would. Every other one of us I have found, I have had to hunt; you walked here on your own feet, and I find I am proud of that, which is a strange thing to feel about someone I mean to kill.
>
> [calm] Sit with me a moment. Did Tesfaye ever speak of me? In all those years he raised you, did he mention my name? I've waited thirty years to hear that he remembered me.
>

> **What do you say?**
> 1. "Never. Not once. He did not know you existed."
> 2. "Only in a letter, after he was dead. He called you my brother."
> 3. "There was nothing to say about you. There still is not." — _blood +1_
>

**KOLADE ADEYINKA** *(reply to 1)*  `q14_spoke_never`

> [a long quiet] Not once. — Thank you. I would rather that than a lie, and you could have lied; I would have believed you. It is easier, somehow. A man cannot be refused by someone who never knew he was at the door.
>

**KOLADE ADEYINKA** *(reply to 2)*  `q14_spoke_letter`

> [very still] "Brother." In his own hand. — He could have written it to me. He knew where I was; he made a point of never coming. I have wondered for thirty years what he would call me, and it turns out he called me the right thing and sent it to you.
>
> [gently] Thank you. That was not a kindness, but it was the truth, and I have had little enough of either.
>

**KOLADE ADEYINKA** *(reply to 3)*  `q14_spoke_nothing`

> [laughing softly] Oh, that is his. That is his exactly; he could put a whole man in a sentence and leave the sentence out. — Good. Then we understand each other, and I do not have to be gentle.
>

_(if any of: Amara in company / flag amaraPassed)_

**AMARA**  `q14_plea`

> [kneeling] Kolade. Please. Look at me. It does not have to be the altar. It can be a cell and a window and me visiting every week for the rest of your life.
>

_(if any of: Amara in company / flag amaraPassed)_

**KOLADE ADEYINKA** *(to Amara)*  `q14_plea_answer`

> [gently] Amara. My love. Get up; you are kneeling in ash.
>
> [cold] No.
>

**KOLADE ADEYINKA**  `q14_altar_last`

> [patient] Now. Say what you came to say. I have waited thirty years to hear it, and I would like to hear it properly, before we begin.
>

> **What do you say?**
> 1. "Tesfaye chose me. He would have chosen you too, if you had let him." — _blood -1_
> 2. "Brother. I am sorry for what they did to you. I am still going to stop you." — _Amara +1; Delphine +1_
> 3. "Get out of my chair." — _blood +1; Layla +1_
>

**KOLADE ADEYINKA** *(reply to 1)*  `q14_last_aldric`

> [flinching, then smooth] He did not know me. He had a choice between two children in a gutter and he took the one that cried less; I have never held it against him. I hold it against the gutter.
>
> [rising] Enough. Draw.
>

**KOLADE ADEYINKA** *(reply to 2)*  `q14_last_brother`

> [very quiet] Sorry. Nobody has said that to me in thirty years, and you say it as if it cost nothing.
>
> [rising] It changes nothing. Draw, brother. Sister. Blood.
>

**KOLADE ADEYINKA** *(reply to 3)*  `q14_last_throne`

> [laughing] YES. Yes. Come and take it. Whichever of us stands up from this floor gets to be a god, and I would honestly be content either way.
>

### After the last fight

*It is over. He is on his knees between you and the chair.*

**KOLADE ADEYINKA**  `q14_beaten`

> [on his knees, bleeding] Well. Well. There it is.
>
> [strangely calm] The chair is right there, {target}. Someone is going to sit in it. You, me, or the next one of us who walks down those stairs. Choose. I am curious, even now; I think I will be curious to the end.
>

> **What do you say?**
> 1. "Nobody sits in it. Starting with you." — _ending: kill_
> 2. "You go up those stairs in chains. Amara asked. I promised." — _if any of: allegiance gauntlet / flag promisedAmara / Amara in company · ending: gauntlet_
> 3. "I sit in it. Move." — _if blood ≥ 2 · ending: usurp_
> 4. "Sit in it, then. Alone. I am going home." — _if blood ≤ -2 · ending: walk_
>

**KOLADE ADEYINKA** *(reply to 1)*  `q14_res_kill`

> [closing his eyes] He chose right, then. Good. Good. I am so tired of choosing.
>

**KOLADE ADEYINKA** *(reply to 2)*  `q14_res_gauntlet`

> [laughing weakly] Chains. Amara — Amara, you have won, do you hear me — you have —
>
> [quiet] Fine. A window. Every week. Fine.
>

**KOLADE ADEYINKA** *(reply to 3)*  `q14_res_usurp`

> [grinning through blood] THERE. There it is. I was right about you.
>
> [dying] It is warm, is it not. The chair. It is so warm.
>

**KOLADE ADEYINKA** *(reply to 4)*  `q14_res_walk`

> [bewildered] You — no. No, you cannot simply — it is RIGHT THERE —
>
> [alone, as you climb] ...it is right there.

## The ending card (on-screen text, not voiced)

**Ending — hero:** Kolade Adeyinka died — or was dragged up the stairs — in the last hour before dawn. The Council read the ledgers aloud in the square. The war with Calder was never declared. Nobody in Varenholm's Gate knows what you are, and the ones who suspect have decided not to say.

**Ending — monster:** Kolade Adeyinka died at the altar and the city cheered you for it. They did not see what you saw in his eyes when the chair was empty, and they do not know that some nights you go back down the stairs alone to look at it.

**Ending — usurper:** You sat down. It was warm. Amara left the city; Layla did not. The Council thanked you, the war was never declared, and the shape-thieves in the sewers have started calling you by a title you did not choose.

**Ending — mercy:** Kolade Adeyinka lives in a cell under the Gauntlet's hall with one window and one visitor a week. The ledgers were read aloud, the war died with the vote, and the chair under the city is still empty. You made sure of that.

**Ending — ascetic:** You left him in the chair and climbed. Halfway up you heard him start to laugh, and then stop. The keepers of the altar found the throne empty at dawn, and nobody knows where he went. You went home. You did not look back.

**Allegiance — gauntlet:** Duke Adebayo recovered. He kept his word: the wanted posters came down in a day, and the company's name went up in the Gauntlet's hall in their place.

**Allegiance — consortium:** Folake took the Consortium, kept her bargain, and has written to you twice about "opportunities." You have not answered. Yet.

**Allegiance — thieves:** Tunde Softfoot has not called in the debt. He says the Undervault is patient. You have started checking the shadows in your own room.

**Allegiance — none:** The Council gave you a medal and a pension and would prefer that you left the city. You have not decided.

**The dukes — both:** Both dukes lived to see the vote. Olumide tells the story with more blood in it every time.

**The dukes — one:** Duke Folasade was buried with the honours of the city. Olumide has not spoken of the hall since.

**The dukes — none:** Two Grand Dukes were buried on the same morning. The Council that is left is one chair and a great many empty ones, and the city has learned to lower its voice.

**Hiwot — present:** Hiwot opened a lockshop on the harbour road. She has never once locked the door.

**Hiwot — gone:** Hiwot went back to Lanternhold with a scar under her ribs and a story that Brother Yonas still does not believe.

**Beau — present:** Beau stopped stammering the day the mine slaves were freed. He has not started again.

**Beau — dead:** Beau is buried in the Mirkhollow above the drowned mine. Delphine chose the stone. Nineteen names are cut under his.

**Delphine — present:** Delphine is rebuilding the Warden house on the Shore Road. She says the letters Tesfaye wrote were mostly about you, and mostly right.

**Delphine — gone:** Delphine went back to the Wardens. She does not write.

**Desmond — present:** Desmond and Winston sent the Umbral Hand a copy of everything and then, oddly, stayed. Winston says the pay is worse and the company is better.

**Desmond — gone:** Desmond and Winston were found in the Consortium tower with the guards' pay in their pockets. The Umbral Hand has not asked after them.

**Santiago — present:** Santiago was knighted by the Order of the Dawning Flame. He wrote the report himself, and left out nothing, and the Order has not stopped talking about it.

**Santiago — gone:** Santiago went back to the Order. He sends a letter every solstice and never mentions Layla or the Hand.

**Itsuki — present:** Itsuki planted a tree over his wife's grave on the north road and then, to everyone's surprise, stayed. He hunts now. Only game.

**Itsuki — gone:** Itsuki is somewhere north, still hunting an ogre-mage who may or may not still be alive. He does not want to be found.

**Bahadır — present:** Bahadır and Yasemin took a house by the river. Fındık has a room. Fındık has a very small bed.

**Devendra — present:** Devendra returned to Vashk with a hundred gold and an insufferable story. The Crimson Wizards have promoted him. They will regret it.

**Layla — present:** Layla stayed. She has a chapel now, of a kind, and the bounty on her was quietly torn up by someone who owed you a favour.

**Layla — gone:** Layla was taken in chains toward the coast. The wagon did not arrive. Nobody has looked very hard.

**Kaito — present:** Kaito collected the wyvern bounty and, he claims, the kiss. He has opened a very small, very profitable business finding things people lost on purpose.

**Kaito — gone:** Kaito is still in the web, in a sense. He was last seen in Thornbury telling the story with himself as the hero.

**Wanjiru — present:** Wanjiru went back to the Mirkhollow. The druids have not forgiven her. The trees, she says, have.

**Dai Morgan — present:** Dai Morgan went back to the Mirkhollow mine with a charter and forty of his clan. It is called the Nineteen now, and ledger four is buried under the first shaft.

**Dai Morgan — gone:** Dai Morgan is presumed to have died in the cages. The mine is closed.

**Amara — present:** Amara visits the cell every week. She brings bread. He eats it.

**Amara — gone:** Amara left the city on the morning tide. She did not say where. She did not look at you.

**Amara — dead:** Amara is buried at the gate of the Undercity, where she stood.

**Romance — Delphine:** Delphine is at the Warden house. So are you, most nights. Neither of you has said Beau's name in front of the other yet. You will.

**Romance — Delphine, favoured ending:** She says Tesfaye would have liked how it ended. Then she says he would have cheated a little. Then she laughs, for the first time since the mine.

**Romance — Santiago:** Santiago asked you to attend his knighting. You did. The Order pretended not to notice you.

**Romance — Santiago, favoured ending:** He calls it the right ending. He calls everything the right ending. This time you agree with him.

**Romance — Itsuki:** Itsuki sleeps through the night now. He says it is the tree. You suspect it is not the tree.

**Romance — Itsuki, favoured ending:** He said "mine" once more, at the altar, and then never again. He did not need to.

**Romance — Layla:** Layla sleeps in the chapel and, when it suits her, elsewhere. She is very clear that it suits her.

**Romance — Layla, favoured ending:** She was standing beside the chair when you sat in it. She has not stopped smiling. It is not a warm smile. It is yours.

**Romance — Kaito:** Kaito still flirts with everything. He says it is professional courtesy. He comes home to one door.

**Romance — Kaito, favoured ending:** The Undervault knows his face now, and yours, and treats you both as family. Tunde says that is the debt, paid.

**Romance — Amara:** Amara brings bread to the cell every week. You walk her there and wait outside. She has never once asked you to come in.

**Romance — Amara, favoured ending:** She said you kept your word. She said it as if it were the strangest thing anyone had ever done for her.

**The blood — reject:** The dreams stopped. The chair is a chair.

**The blood — neutral:** You still dream of ash, some nights. Less often. You have stopped counting.

**The blood — embrace:** You dream of the chair every night now. Some nights it is empty. Some nights it is not, and the one sitting in it has your face.

## Amara  `amara`

**Sex:** female · **Role:** companion (romanceable) · **Voice ID:** nlQtoxiWTYC3witBlK1H

**Who they are:** Kolade's lover and sword-hand. A monk of the Gate's fire temples who wants him stopped, not slaughtered. Grave, exact, tired.

**From:** Varenholm's Gate — dukes, Gauntlet, Consortium, temples, thieves — Nigerian (Yoruba and Igbo). **Voice:** Grand, formal city English. "It is not a small matter", "my friend", "ah-ah!", "I am telling you", "o" softening the end of a line. Titles matter; elders are "Baba" and "Mama".

**q9_romance**

- `q9_romance_1` — [quiet] I loved a man who wanted to be a god. I am not proud of it, and I am not sorry for it.
- `q9_romance_2` — [steady] I do not know what I want from you. I know that when you kept your word at the gate, something in me turned toward you the way a plant turns to a window. Say something, or do not.

**q9_romance_no**

- `q9_romance_no_1` — [calm] That is fair. I have asked enough of you for one life. The altar, then.

**q9_romance_yes**

- `q9_romance_yes_1` — [exhaling] Then we will find out what it is together. After the altar. If there is an after.

**q11_amara_how**

- `q11_amara_how_1` — [exact] Chains, and a cell, and the Council's law. He is not a god yet. He bleeds, he tires, he can be beaten to his knees; I have seen it done, once, in the fire temple where we met. On his knees he can be bound. It is not a small thing I ask. I know that.

**q11_amara_lie**

- `q11_amara_lie_1` — [searching]...Your word. Yes. — Rasheed and Kemi, the Undervault. The invitations. Go.

**q11_amara_promise**

- `q11_amara_promise_1` — [exhaling] Thank you. I did not expect that.
- `q11_amara_promise_2` — [quiet] The coronation is in three nights. Two people called Rasheed and Kemi hold the invitations in the Undervault. Take them from them; they will not give them up.

**q11_amara_refuse**

- `q11_amara_refuse_1` — [cold] Then we will meet at the gate of the Undercity, and one of us will not walk past the other.
- `q11_amara_refuse_2` — [flat] Rasheed and Kemi hold the invitations. Undervault. Take them; it does not change what I said.

**q11_docks**

- `q11_docks_1` — [steady] Put the swords away. If I wanted you dead I would have done it from the rooftop.
- `q11_docks_2` — [grave] I am Amara. I love Kolade Adeyinka. I also helped him kill the man who raised you. I know what that makes me to you. But I need you to hear me. Have you ever loved someone even after you knew what they'd done?

**q11_docks_ask**

- `q11_docks_ask_1` — [grave] Here is what I ask. Stop him. Not kill him. Stop him. There is a difference, and it matters to me more than my own life.

**q11_docks_ithrel_reply**

- `q11_docks_ithrel_reply_1` — [without flinching] No. I was not. But I did not stop him sending Gorruk north, and I could have. Put that on my account with the rest, ranger. I will not argue the sum.

**q11_loved_no**

- `q11_loved_no_1` — [level] Then you will think what I ask is weakness. Hear it anyway; you may need it later, when you are older and less certain.

**q11_loved_tesfaye**

- `q11_loved_tesfaye_1` — [quiet] He lied to keep you. Kolade has never lied to anyone in his life; it is not the same thing, and I think you know it. But yes. It counts. It means you can hear me.

**q11_loved_yes**

- `q11_loved_yes_1` — [a slow nod] Then you know the shape of it. Good. I will not have to explain the rest, only ask it.

**q13_gate**

- `q13_gate_1` — [quiet] I said one of us would not walk past the other.
- `q13_gate_2` — [steady] I am still asking. Stop him. Do not kill him. And if you cannot promise me that, then draw, because I will not let you reach him without it.

**q13_gate_fight**

- `q13_gate_fight_1` — [sad] Then draw.

**q13_gate_join**

- `q13_gate_join_1` — [startled] With — yes. Yes. I know the way; I have walked it a hundred times. Stay behind me at the stairs.

**q13_gate_lie**

- `q13_gate_lie_1` — [searching your face]...Go, then. If you are lying, I will know it at the altar.

**q13_gate_pass**

- `q13_gate_pass_1` — [stepping aside] Go. I will be at the altar before you, on my knees, asking him the same thing. He will not listen to me. He might listen to you.

**q14_plea**

- `q14_plea_1` — [kneeling] Kolade. Please. Look at me. It does not have to be the altar. It can be a cell and a window and me visiting every week for the rest of your life.

**banter**

- `banter_1` — [exact] Two blades. Two throats. Next.
- `banter_2` — [steady] Watch the flank. I have the front.
- `banter_3` — [quiet] Not like this. Quickly. Clean.

## Bahadır  `bramm`

**Sex:** male · **Role:** companion · **Voice ID:** ZZKBkhKNX9bfxn63cQTM

**Who they are:** A huge, loud ranger of Kalden with a hamster named Fındık on his shoulder and a witch to protect. Loyal to the bone.

**From:** Kalden, the witch-country beyond the steppe — Turkish. **Voice:** Warm and emphatic. "Abla" / "abi" for elder sister and brother, "canım" for the beloved, "vallahi" as an oath, "inşallah" for hope. Hospitality as a rule of war.

**q3_bramm**

- `q3_bramm_1` — [booming] — and I say AGAIN, red man, you touch that cage and I will fold you into it!
- `q3_bramm_2` — [turning] VALLAHI. Strangers. Good. Strangers, listen: Bahadır, ranger of Kalden, and this is Fındık, who is small but very brave. There is a woman in that fortress, in a cage. Yasemin. A witch of my country, and a good one.

**q3_bramm_argue**

- `q3_bramm_argue_1` — [hot] Tell them why Vashk burns women, wizard! Tell them what your Crimson masters do with a witch's bones!

**q3_bramm_rescue**

- `q3_bramm_rescue_1` — [overjoyed] With you! Yes! Fındık, did you hear? We have friends, and they are good ones. Come — the gate is that way, and I am going through it.

**q3_joined**

- `q3_joined_1` — [emphatic] We are yours. Vallahi. Where you go, we go, and anyone who says otherwise answers to Fındık.

**q3_road_block**

- `q3_road_block_1` — [wounded, roaring] You TOOK his coin. You looked at me and you took his coin! Then you go through me, and Fındık, and every tree in this valley — come on! COME ON!

**banter**

- `banter_1` — [roaring] FINDIK SAYS GO FOR THE EYES!
- `banter_2` — [booming] Nobody touches the witch! NOBODY! Vallahi!
- `banter_3` — [gleeful] Ha HA! Did you SEE that, canım?

## Beau  `dorran`

**Sex:** male · **Role:** companion · **Voice ID:** 7ma36jg9JC0d1pfrWXMw

**Who they are:** A Warden fighter from the Shore Road with a stammer he hates and a shield he never puts down. Delphine's husband.

**From:** Thornbury, the Shore Road and the Wardens' country — Georgia, USA. **Voice:** Warm drawl. "I reckon", "I'll tell you what", "y'all", "fixing to", "bless him". Plain-spoken courtesy; ma'am and sir to strangers. Long vowels, short tempers.

**q2_beau_seal**

- `q2_beau_seal_1` — [low] Del. The p-paper the man on the steps had. Look at the seal. Iron hand, red wax.
- `q2_beau_seal_2` — [steadier] That's the mark on the ore wagons. The ones that come up from Dunmere and go north. I've seen it a hundred times at the ford.

**q2_selene**

- `q2_selene_1` — [stammering, warm] You're — y-you're his. Tesfaye's. I'd know that coat anywhere; he w-wore it the day we met. Come in. Come in out of the road.
- `q2_selene_2` — [quiet] Del. It's the ward. He sent the ward.

**q7_after**

- `q7_after_1` — [exhausted] Nineteen. Every one. Not one left in the dark.
- `q7_after_2` — [quiet] Thank you for holding. I heard you say it. I won't forget it.

**q7_cage_beau**

- `q7_cage_beau_1` — [urgent] The ch-chain-gang. Where do they keep them between shifts?

**q7_dorran_mission**

- `q7_dorran_mission_1` — [quiet] There'll be time. I'll m-make time.

**q7_dorran_with**

- `q7_dorran_with_1` — [fierce] Good. G-good. The front's mine. Nothing gets past me today.

**q7_flood_wait**

- `q7_flood_wait_1` — [shouting from below] Coming up! Nineteen of 'em and me! Hold the d-door — they're right behind us!

**q7_gate**

- `q7_gate_1` — [grim] Slaves. They're w-working slaves in there. I can hear the chains from here.
- `q7_gate_2` — [steady] I'm going to the bottom for 'em. Whatever else we do today. Tell me you're with me.

**banter**

- `banter_1` — [steady] H-hold the line. Hold it. Nothing gets past.
- `banter_2` — [grunting] Shield's up. Hit 'em while they hit me.
- `banter_3` — [shouting] Del! Behind you!

## Dai Morgan  `durnik`

**Sex:** male · **Role:** companion · **Voice ID:** QZU5JP2C26gx328DNBza

**Who they are:** A dwarf priest whose clan dug the Mirkhollow mine before the Consortium stole it. Slow to anger, impossible to move.

**From:** Dunmere and the dwarf clans — Welsh valleys. **Voice:** Sing-song cadence, sentences that end where they started ("I'll go down, I will"). "Bach", "now then", "there's lovely", "duw". Understatement about danger.

**q7_cage**

- `q7_cage_1` — [gravelly, Welsh] Well now. Either you're the new drivers or the old ones are dead. Which is it, then? — No, don't tell me; you're too muddy for drivers, and they'd have shot me by now.
- `q7_cage_2` — [hopeful] Dai Morgan. Priest of the deep places, and the last of the clan that cut this mine before the Consortium took it with paper and knives. I know every valve in it — including the one at the bottom that lets the river in.

**q7_cage_ask**

- `q7_cage_ask_1` — [hopeful] So. Are you letting me out, or are you the polite sort of drivers?

**q7_cage_beau_reply**

- `q7_cage_beau_reply_1` — [grim] Bottom level, by the valve room, so the drivers can drown them if the mine's ever taken. Mind that, shield-man. Whoever turns that wheel turns it on them.

**q7_durnik_free**

- `q7_durnik_free_1` — [grunting to his feet] With you. Aye. There's lovely. Mind the third level; the mage keeps his study there, and he doesn't care for knocking.

**q7_durnik_leave**

- `q7_durnik_leave_1` — [flat] Come back for me. Aye. Everybody says that, bach.

**q7_durnik_paper**

- `q7_durnik_paper_1` — [grim] A debt we didn't owe, bought off a man who didn't own it, and enforced by men with swords while the magistrate looked at the ceiling. My cousins argued. My cousins are on the lowest level now, and they don't argue anymore.

**q7_study_dai**

- `q7_study_dai_1` — [very level] Morgan. Bryn and Gareth Morgan. My cousins. Which ledger are they in, mage?

**q7_study_dai_after**

- `q7_study_dai_after_1` — [quiet]...Then I'll be having ledger four. Go on.

**q7_valve**

- `q7_valve_1` — [urgent] The valve room. Turn the great wheel and the river takes the bottom two levels in the time it takes to say a prayer.
- `q7_valve_2` — [hard] Your shield-man went below for the chain-gang. He isn't up yet.

**q8_sewers**

- `q8_sewers_1` — [approving] Good stonework, mind. Dwarven, some of it, and old. Shame about the smell.

**q9_lobby**

- `q9_lobby_1` — [gravelly] Clerk with a list. Two guards. Good stone, again. Shame.

**q9_lobby_fight**

- `q9_lobby_fight_1` — [grim] Stairs.

**q9_lobby_talk**

- `q9_lobby_talk_1` — [grunting] Third floor. Don't touch anything. Good advice for a tower, that.

**banter**

- `banter_1` — [gravelly] Wall. I'm the wall, I am.
- `banter_2` — [grunting] Hit 'em. I've got 'em.
- `banter_3` — [calm] The deep places keep me. Keep going, bach.

## Delphine  `selene`

**Sex:** female · **Role:** companion (romanceable) · **Voice ID:** a3tSl2M9CVI359Oy7H6v

**Who they are:** A Warden druid of the Shore Road, Tesfaye's old friend. Blunt, protective, allergic to self-pity. Speaks for the balance of things.

**From:** Thornbury, the Shore Road and the Wardens' country — Georgia, USA. **Voice:** Warm drawl. "I reckon", "I'll tell you what", "y'all", "fixing to", "bless him". Plain-spoken courtesy; ma'am and sir to strangers. Long vowels, short tempers.

**q2_how_armour**

- `q2_how_armour_1` — [very still] Black plate. Asked for you by name.
- `q2_how_armour_2` — [to Beau] Beau. The letter from the spring. He said if a big man in black iron ever came asking, we weren't to fight him, we were to run with the child and ask questions after. I thought he'd gone strange.

**q2_how_quick**

- `q2_how_quick_1` — [gently] That's a kindness, and a lie, and I'll take both. Thank you, sugar.
- `q2_how_quick_2` — [to Beau] Beau. Whoever did it knew where Tesfaye was, and Tesfaye chose that library because nobody knew. Somebody talked.

**q2_how_refuse**

- `q2_how_refuse_1` — [soft] Then don't. But you'll tell Beau when you can; he loved him too, and he's worse at waiting than I am.

**q2_join**

- `q2_join_1` — [decisive] Beau, get the shields. We're going to Dunmere.
- `q2_join_2` — [to you] I'll tell you what: you're Tesfaye's, and Tesfaye's is ours. That's all the reason we need, and it's all the reason you're getting tonight.

**q2_selene**

- `q2_selene_1` — [blunt] Sit down before you fall down, honey. Both of you. Beau, get the good bread.
- `q2_selene_2` — [steady] Tesfaye wrote to us every year for twenty years, and every letter said the same thing: if the child ever comes to your door alone, it means I am dead, and you are to do what I would have done.
- `q2_selene_3` — [quiet, direct] So. How did he die? All of it. Don't you spare me.

**q2_selene_alone**

- `q2_selene_alone_1` — [flat] You'll go with us or you'll go over my husband, and he's a big man. Tesfaye asked. I don't break a promise to a dead friend because a child is grieving and rude about it.

**q2_selene_seal**

- `q2_selene_seal_1` — [looking] It is. The Iron Consortium's mark — the trading house out of the Gate that's been buying every bar on this coast since the ore went bad.
- `q2_selene_seal_2` — [slowly] So the folks paying to kill Tesfaye's ward are the folks who own the iron. That ain't two stories, honey. That's one. Now you ask me whatever you need to, and then we decide what he'd have done.

**q2_selene_trust**

- `q2_selene_trust_1` — [softening] He'd have followed the money. The iron's gone bad since spring — tools snapping, blades cracking, every smith from here to the Gate cussing — and the ore comes up out of Dunmere. The Consortium's mark is on the wagons and on your bounty. So we go to Dunmere and find out what's wrong with that ore, and I'd bet my house we find out who wants you dead the same day.

**q2_selene_wardens**

- `q2_selene_wardens_1` — [matter-of-fact] Folks who keep the balance between the towns and the wild, and between the strong and the weak, when the law's too far off to do it. Tesfaye was one, before the library. So are we. It don't pay, and nobody thanks you, and you do it anyway. That's the whole of the oath.

**q2_selene_why**

- `q2_selene_why_1` — [carefully] I don't know, and I won't pretend I do. I know Tesfaye hid you like a man hides a lit candle in a wind, and never said from what. A trading house don't spend two hundred on spite. They think you're worth it, or they think you're dangerous, and I can't tell you which from here.

**q3_ithrel_selene**

- `q3_ithrel_selene_1` — [sharp] A year hunting one ogre alone, and the Wardens never heard of you. Why didn't you come to us?

**q3_ithrel_selene_after**

- `q3_ithrel_selene_after_1` — [a beat]...It ain't. Damn it. It should be.

**q3_south**

- `q3_south_1` — [calm] Dunmere's two days south. Mining town, hard folk, honest as far as it goes. The mayor's a man called Gethin Pryce; he'll be sweating, and he'll pay.
- `q3_south_2` — [dry] Stay off the river road after dark. Gnolls come down it. I know because I've buried the people who didn't listen.

**q3_south_hiwot**

- `q3_south_hiwot_1` — [casual, not casual] Hiwot. You grew up in that library with him. Did he keep letters? Anything from the Gate, anything with that iron seal on it?

**q3_south_hiwot_reply**

- `q3_south_hiwot_reply_1` — [nodding] Then it's still there. Remember that, both of you. If this road ever bends back toward Lanternhold, that drawer's the first door we open.

**q3_tollan_selene**

- `q3_tollan_selene_1` — [level] Gethin. Before the crews. Who's been buying your bad ore since spring, and who's been selling the smiths good iron since?

**q3_tollan_selene_after**

- `q3_tollan_selene_after_1` — [to Beau, quiet] Same hand. Beau, I told you. Buy the ore cheap because it's bad, sell the iron dear because it's the only good iron left. Somebody's making that ore bad on purpose.

**q4_camp_selene**

- `q4_camp_selene_1` — [after a moment] He was the best of us, sugar. And he quit. Those ain't two different stories either.

**q4_down**

- `q4_down_1` — [calm] Mind the timbers; half of them are rotten. If the kobolds are as thick as the mayor says, we go slow and we keep the healer in the middle. That's me, honey. Don't argue.

**q4_flooded**

- `q4_flooded_1` — [calm] Water on the second level, and not from any spring. Somebody opened a channel and let the river in on purpose.
- `q4_flooded_2` — [thoughtful] Kobolds don't plan. Kobolds dig where they're pointed. Whoever's pointing them is below us, and has been for weeks.

**q4_grukhar_selene**

- `q4_grukhar_selene_1` — [flat] Your orders. Sealed how? Iron hand, red wax, pressed hard.

**q4_grukhar_selene_after**

- `q4_grukhar_selene_after_1` — [to you, low] On a wagon, on a bounty, and now on an altar. That's three. — Go on, honey. He's yours to deal with.

**q4_letters**

- `q4_letters_1` — [reading] "To the priest, from Femi at the Thornbury inn. Keep the ore fouled until the spring shipment. Gorruk holds the north road; do not use it without his mark."
- `q4_letters_2` — [calm] A courier, and a bandit lord above him, and above them somebody who buys with a seal instead of a name. The mine was only the bottom of this.

**q5_inn_selene**

- `q5_inn_selene_1` — [pleasant, deadly] Hollister says you've had that room since the spring, Femi. Now I'll tell you what puzzles me. What does a wine merchant sell for six months in a town with one inn, that already has a cellar?

**q5_inn_selene_after**

- `q5_inn_selene_after_1` — [to you] He's got papers, honey. I'd like to see them.

**q5_letters_selene**

- `q5_letters_selene_1` — [level] A name, Cal. Not a seal. Somebody at the Consortium signs for this. Who?

**q6_fire**

- `q6_fire_1` — [quiet] Sit a minute. The forest's loud tonight and I want to say a thing before I lose the nerve.
- `q6_fire_2` — [soft] Tesfaye wrote to us every year about you. Twenty letters. I feel like I've known you since you could walk, and I met you a month ago. It's a strange thing. It ain't an unwelcome one.

**q6_fire_deflect**

- `q6_fire_deflect_1` — [dry] I should. So should you. Neither one of us will.
- `q6_fire_deflect_2` — [calm] Goodnight.

**q6_fire_dorran**

- `q6_fire_dorran_1` — [fond] He is. He also snores like a bear in a barrel, so the fortune runs both ways.
- `q6_fire_dorran_2` — [warm] Goodnight. Don't you tell him I said that.

**q6_fire_letters**

- `q6_fire_letters_1` — [fond] The first year, that you'd learned to walk and walked straight into the library. The seventh, that you'd stolen honey from the brothers and let a cat take the blame. The last — that you were ready, and that he wasn't.

**q6_fire_warm**

- `q6_fire_warm_1` — [a soft laugh] Enough. Yeah. That's a very Tesfaye amount.
- `q6_fire_warm_2` — [warm] Goodnight. Wake me if the trees start walking.

**q6_forest**

- `q6_forest_1` — [calm] The Mirkhollow. Old wood — older than the Wardens, older than the Gate. It's got its own druids, and they ain't friends of ours; we keep the balance by law and they keep it by blood.
- `q6_forest_2` — [quiet] Keep to the deer paths. Anything down here that looks like a road was made by something with a great many legs.

**q6_gate**

- `q6_gate_1` — [calm] Iron livery on the guards. Consortium men. And the tall one — Kestrel. A sword for hire who'll guard anything for anybody. I've crossed him before.
- `q6_gate_2` — [flat] He won't talk. Don't waste your breath on it.

**q6_grove_selene**

- `q6_grove_selene_1` — [steady] None of us. The iron's what we took off the men who are poisoning your river. We're here to shut their mine.

**q7_after_dead**

- `q7_after_dead_1` — [hollow] Olamide's papers. Names in the city. Take them. I don't care.
- `q7_after_dead_2` — [cold] I'll finish this road because Tesfaye asked it of me. Don't you speak to me until it's done.

**q7_flood_now**

- `q7_flood_now_1` — [screaming] NO —
- `q7_flood_now_2` — [broken] He was coming up. He was coming up. You heard the chains. You heard him.

**q7_papers**

- `q7_papers_1` — [reading] Olamide wrote to three men at the Consortium's tower in Varenholm's Gate. Adigun Adeyinka. Bankole. Rotimi.
- `q7_papers_2` — [calm] Adeyinka. Cal heard right. The bandits are broke and the mine's drowned, and the road north is open, and so, at last, are the names.

**q7_valve**

- `q7_valve_1` — [tight] Beau's still down there. Beau is still down there.

**q8_faces**

- `q8_faces_1` — [disturbed] That's the merchant's face and it ain't the merchant. Look at the eyes, honey. Nothing lives behind 'em.
- `q8_faces_2` — [hard] Shape-thieves. They wear you after they kill you. Don't let one get behind you.

**q9_lobby**

- `q9_lobby_1` — [murmuring] A clerk with a list and two guards who are paid to believe him.

**q9_lobby_fight**

- `q9_lobby_fight_1` — [flat] Stairs, then.

**q9_lobby_talk**

- `q9_lobby_talk_1` — [quiet] He believed it. Third floor. Don't touch anything.

**q9_romance**

- `q9_romance_1` — [quiet] I buried my husband three weeks ago, and I'm ashamed of what I'm fixing to say, so I'll say it fast.
- `q9_romance_2` — [steady] I ain't asking for anything. I'm telling you that when this is over, if you asked, I'd say yes. That's all. That's a great deal, for me, and it's more than I've got a right to.

**q9_romance_no**

- `q9_romance_no_1` — [gentle] Then it's said and it's done, and nothing between us changes. Sleep well.

**q9_romance_yes**

- `q9_romance_yes_1` — [a soft, unsteady laugh] Then that's settled, and I'm going to sleep before I say anything foolish.
- `q9_romance_yes_2` — [warm] Goodnight, sugar. Actually goodnight.

**q9_top**

- `q9_top_1` — [reading] Adigun Adeyinka, Bankole, Rotimi. Gone to Lanternhold — to LANTERNHOLD — for a summit with the keepers.
- `q9_top_2` — [cold] The three men behind all of this are sitting in the library you grew up in.

**q10_double_listen**

- `q10_double_listen_1` — [urgent] That ain't who it looks like. That is NOT them. It's already reaching for your throat — move!

**q10_double_strike**

- `q10_double_strike_1` — [sharp] Two of 'em — and the real Hiwot was BEHIND it, you cut her — she's breathing. She's breathing. She ain't walking out of here on her own.
- `q10_double_strike_2` — [grim] I'll get her to the surface. Go on without us.

**q10_double_strike_alone**

- `q10_double_strike_alone_1` — [grim] That wasn't him, and you knew it before I did. It's dead. There's two more behind it wearing faces I don't know — keep moving.

**q10_shore**

- `q10_shore_1` — [weary] The shore. Air. We're out.
- `q10_shore_2` — [hard] Every keeper in Lanternhold thinks we killed three men tonight, and the man who did it was inside those walls wearing somebody's face.

**q10_summit_selene**

- `q10_summit_selene_1` — [flat] Then answer me this, Adeyinka, before anybody decides anything. The iron hand in red wax on the ore wagons. Whose seal is that?

**q10_summit_selene_after**

- `q10_summit_selene_after_1` — [to you, quiet] Your seal on the wagons and his on the bounty. Same wax. I've been right since the inn, honey, and I ain't glad of it.

**q11_alleg_consortium**

- `q11_alleg_consortium_1` — [flat] Her. Fine. I'll hold my nose. Don't you let her hold anything of yours.

**q11_alleg_gauntlet**

- `q11_alleg_gauntlet_1` — [approving] Lawfully. Tesfaye would've said the same, and then he'd have cheated a little. Let's go find the Duke.

**q11_alleg_thieves**

- `q11_alleg_thieves_1` — [dry] Tunde Softfoot never forgets a debt. Neither will you. All right — the Undervault.

**q11_doors**

- `q11_doors_1` — [calm] Three ways into that palace, and we won't get a second try.
- `q11_doors_2` — [measured] Adebayo's dying; cure him and the Gauntlet is ours. Folake offered a way in, for a price. And the thieves under the Undervault will sell us a door if we owe 'em after.

**q11_posters**

- `q11_posters_1` — [cold] Grand Duke Ayodele was murdered last night and they've put your name on it. Obi's dead too. A man called Segun Marr runs the Gauntlet now.
- `q11_posters_2` — [calm] Kolade will be sworn in as the new Duke within days. He's moved everything into place while we were underground.

**q12_dukes_korvath**

- `q12_dukes_korvath_1` — [shouting] The dukes are DYING — we can't hold both if you run at him —

**q12_steps**

- `q12_steps_1` — [low] Borrowed silks, real steel, two invitations. Everybody in that hall is either a guest or a shape-thief, and there's no way to tell which till the knives come out.
- `q12_steps_2` — [calm] Stay near the dukes. He needs them dead more than he needs you.

**q13_steps_selene**

- `q13_steps_selene_1` — [flat] Where's Emeka Obi, Marr? He had a wife on Tanner Street. She'd like to know where to put the flowers.

**q14_mirrors**

- `q14_mirrors_1` — [cold] Our faces. Every one. Kill 'em quick; don't look at the eyes.

**q14_sanctum**

- `q14_sanctum_1` — [low] A temple to a dead god, still swept, still lit. Somebody's been praying here for twenty years.
- `q14_sanctum_2` — [steady] Whatever he says at that altar, you remember who raised you. Then you do what you have to.

**banter**

- `banter_1` — [calm] Breathe, honey. The one in front's slower than he looks.
- `banter_2` — [sharp] Mind the mage. I'll mind the rest.
- `banter_3` — [dry] If you die, I will be very put out. Don't.

## Desmond  `vess`

**Sex:** male · **Role:** companion · **Voice ID:** 5OtKrUz8y0NUBuMW6YcK

**Who they are:** An Umbral Hand necromancer who giggles at wounds. Unstable, brilliant, always listening for the Hand.

**From:** The Umbral Hand — Jamaican. **Voice:** Light patois rhythm through word order and idiom, not spelling: "man", "you see it?", "no worry yourself", "one-one coco full basket". Dry warmth from Winston; sing-song from Desmond.

**q2_pair**

- `q2_pair_1` — [bright] Well now — look at this, Winston. Two little travellers on a big empty road, and one of them holding a sword like it might bite.
- `q2_pair_2` — [delighted] Desmond. This is Winston. We are going the same way as you, which is a coincidence, and we are very good in a fight, which is not.

**q2_pair_yes**

- `q2_pair_yes_1` — [sing-song] You hear that, Winston? We have friends now. — No worry yourself. I bite only the ones you tell me to.

**q2_where_lie**

- `q2_where_lie_1` — [gleeful] Lying. Look at the hands, Winston — the hands always know. I like them already.
- `q2_where_lie_2` — [sing-song] No worry yourself. Everybody lies to us. We are used to it.

**q7_papers**

- `q7_papers_1` — [soft] Those papers. Names, seals, routes. The people we answer to would pay plenty to read them before the Gauntlet does.
- `q7_papers_2` — [softer] Let Winston copy them tonight, and we stay quiet and useful for as long as you like.

**q7_papers_refuse**

- `q7_papers_refuse_1` — [very calm] Then we go, and you will see us again, and it won't be as friends.
- `q7_papers_refuse_2` — [light] It never was, really. I did tell you stories like yours get told badly.

**q9_betrayal**

- `q9_betrayal_1` — [bright] You found us! We work here now, you see it? It pays better than you did.
- `q9_betrayal_2` — [giggling] Winston says we should kill you quick. Me, I would like to take my time.

**banter**

- `banter_1` — [giggling] Oh, he is BURNING. Look at him go, man.
- `banter_2` — [sing-song] More, more, more —
- `banter_3` — [delighted] I love this company. Nobody screams at me.

## Devendra  `aurelius`

**Sex:** male · **Role:** companion · **Voice ID:** Sm4AUh4ykvT9ljuZ5Uy8

**Who they are:** A Crimson Wizard of Vashk who narrates his own superiority under his breath. Wants Yasemin dead; wants you useful.

**From:** Vashk and its Crimson Wizards — Indian. **Voice:** Ornate, formal, self-satisfied. "Kindly", "most assuredly", "it is quite evident". Compliments that are insults; never raises his voice.

**q3_bramm**

- `q3_bramm_1` — [disdainful] Kindly disregard the large gentleman; his enthusiasms are exhausting. Devendra, Crimson Wizard of Vashk. The woman in the cage is a Kalden witch, and it is quite evident that a Kalden witch loose in these hills is a calamity waiting for a date.

**q3_bramm_argue**

- `q3_bramm_argue_1` — [coolly] Vashk and Kalden have been at war, in one form or another, since before these strangers' grandparents were born. I do not expect the large gentleman to understand policy. I expect him to understand a hundred in gold — which I am offering to you, not to him. A hundred to see her burned, and my considerable talents beside you until the Gate.

**q3_bramm_both**

- `q3_bramm_both_1` — [thin] Hold my tongue. Very well. I shall hold it most eloquently. Do not expect me to be happy about it.

**q3_bramm_coin**

- `q3_bramm_coin_1` — [satisfied] A sensible arrangement. The large gentleman will object; I recommend we not be near him when he does.

**q3_bramm_why**

- `q3_bramm_why_1` — [coolly] Because one witch becomes a coven, and a coven becomes a border dispute, and a border dispute becomes my problem. That I am polite about it is a courtesy, not a change of policy.

**banter**

- `banter_1` — [bored] Do kindly keep them off me; I am the expensive one.
- `banter_2` — [smug] Burning. Obviously.
- `banter_3` — [sneering] Barely worth the spell.

## Hiwot  `wren_ward`

**Sex:** female · **Role:** companion · **Voice ID:** 0F4ybvRD5Lm0AIt5almW

**Who they are:** Your foster-sister from Lanternhold, raised beside you in the keepers' library. Quick hands, quicker mouth, hides fear behind jokes.

**From:** Lanternhold and the hill keeps — Ethiopian highlands. **Voice:** Formal, unhurried, proverb-rich. Blessings and "my child". Sentences finish; nothing is clipped. Anger comes out quieter, not louder.

**q1_catchup**

- `q1_catchup_1` — [breathless] Oh, thank every saint that listens. I saw you both leave and I followed — yes, I know, I was not supposed to — and then I saw the torches, and the big one in the black armour, and I ran the other way, because I am not brave. I am only fast.
- `q1_catchup_2` — [quieter] He is dead. Tesfaye. I saw him fall. I can't believe we left him there. He should be with us.
- `q1_catchup_3` — [urgent] Tell me what the big one said to him. I was too far; I saw his mouth move and Tesfaye shake his head. What did he want?

**q1_join**

- `q1_join_1` — [firm] I am coming with you. I can pick locks and keep watch while you sleep. Besides, if you leave me here, I will only have to follow you again.

**q1_wren_cold**

- `q1_wren_cold_1` — [stung, then flat] Right. I am fine. — I have his letter. An inn and two names. You may read it when you have finished being a wall.

**q1_wren_dark**

- `q1_wren_dark_1` — [uneasy] "What you are." He said that? — You sounded like him just then. Not Tesfaye. The other one. [softer] There is a letter. An inn, two names. Let us go and be alive first. You can be terrible later.

**q1_wren_kind**

- `q1_wren_kind_1` — [steadying] He wanted you. By name. Then it was never about Tesfaye at all. — Close. Yes. I can do close. I have his letter; it was in his coat. An inn on the Shore Road, and two names, Beau and Delphine. He must have meant for us to go to them.

**q2_cassian_hiwot**

- `q2_cassian_hiwot_1` — [sceptical] Alone. Who sends one squire to a wolf den? What did you do to your Order?

**q2_morwin_hiwot**

- `q2_morwin_hiwot_1` — [quickly] Neither. We are pilgrims. Going to the shrine at — the shrine.

**q2_notice**

- `q2_notice_1` — [picking up the paper] He was carrying this. Your face, and a bounty, and a seal of an iron hand in red wax. No name.
- `q2_notice_2` — [quiet] Somebody with a great deal of money wants you dead badly enough to send two men in one night and a third to wait at the one door Tesfaye trusted. I am keeping this. Somebody at that inn will know the mark.

**q2_pair_hiwot**

- `q2_pair_hiwot_1` — [low, to you] Do not tell them anything. We do not know them.

**q2_road**

- `q2_road_1` — [reading] "The Open Hand, on the Shore Road, past the salt-flats. Ask for Beau and Delphine. They are Wardens, and they were my friends before you were born. Trust them as you would trust me." — That is all it says. He never wasted ink.
- `q2_road_2` — [thinking] Wardens. He never once said that word in twenty years, and now it is the first thing he wants us to know. That is the first thing I am asking them.

**q2_wolves**

- `q2_wolves_1` — [low] Wolves. Road wolves, the big grey kind — Tesfaye said they only come down to the road when the hills are hungry.
- `q2_wolves_2` — [very quiet] Something has made the hills hungry.

**q3_south_hiwot**

- `q3_south_hiwot_1` — [thinking] A locked drawer in his study. I never got it open, and I tried twice, which he knew, because he moved the key. He never moved anything else.
- `q3_south_hiwot_2` — [quiet] It is still there. Whatever it is.

**q4_camp_hiwot**

- `q4_camp_hiwot_1` — [quiet, at the fire] Delphine. Was he a good Warden? Tesfaye. He never talked about it, and I have been wondering all day whether that was because it was bad, or because it was good.

**q4_down**

- `q4_down_1` — [low] It smells like wet dog and hot metal. Four levels of that, going down.
- `q4_down_2` — [quiet] If I go quiet down here it is not because I am frightened. It is because I am very frightened, and I would rather you did not know.

**q4_letters**

- `q4_letters_1` — [reading] "Keep the ore fouled until the spring shipment. Gorruk holds the north road." And a name — Femi, at the inn in Thornbury.
- `q4_letters_2` — [quiet] Tesfaye died over a shipping schedule. That cannot be the whole of it. It cannot.

**q5_camp**

- `q5_camp_1` — [whispering] Or I go over the palisade and open the back gate while every eye is on the front.

**q5_camp_quiet**

- `q5_camp_quiet_1` — [breathless] The back gate is open. Two sentries were sleeping, and one of them is going to wake with a headache and no boots.
- `q5_camp_quiet_2` — [low] The big tent is the lord's. There is a man chained in it who looks as though he still has jokes left.

**q5_camp_storm**

- `q5_camp_storm_1` — [resigned] Loud, then. Go for the one with the horns first; the rest will look to him.

**q5_verlan_pocket**

- `q5_verlan_pocket_1` — [murmuring] Map, seal, and a very old sausage. He did not feel a thing.
- `q5_verlan_pocket_2` — [low] Past Holloway Vale, under the oaks. There is a note about the road being watched.

**q6_forest**

- `q6_forest_1` — [low] Old trees. Very old, very big. Things in the branches that stop moving when we look.
- `q6_forest_2` — [a breath] I will go first. No. I will not. You go first.

**q6_wyverns**

- `q6_wyverns_1` — [appalled] It has a sting on its tail. Its tail has a sting.

**q7_cages**

- `q7_cages_1` — [sick] They keep them in cages between shifts. Like dogs. Worse than dogs; I have seen dogs kept better than this.

**q7_flood_now**

- `q7_flood_now_1` — [shouting] NO —
- `q7_flood_now_2` — [hollow] He was coming up. We could hear the chains.

**q7_papers**

- `q7_papers_1` — [reading] Three names at the Consortium's tower in the city. Adigun Adeyinka, Bankole, Rotimi.
- `q7_papers_2` — [quiet] The road north is open now. There is nothing between us and the Gate but the Gate.

**q7_valve**

- `q7_valve_1` — [frantic] Beau is below with the chain-gang. If you turn that wheel he drowns with them.

**q8_door**

- `q8_door_1` — [whispering] Doorman. I can get us past him. He will not even remember we were here.

**q8_door_force**

- `q8_door_force_1` — [sighing] Loud again. I am keeping a list.

**q8_door_wren**

- `q8_door_wren_1` — [smug] Side window. He is asleep on his feet. I told you.

**q8_faces**

- `q8_faces_1` — [horrified] That is the merchant's face. That is his FACE and it is not him. Nothing is behind the eyes.

**q8_sewers**

- `q8_sewers_1` — [gagging] I have been in a mine, a fortress and a spider nest this month, and THIS is the worst. This is the worst place.

**q9_lobby**

- `q9_lobby_1` — [whispering] A clerk. Two guards. A very long list of names on his desk, and we are not on it.

**q9_lobby_fight**

- `q9_lobby_fight_1` — [flat] So much for quiet. Stairs. Go.

**q9_lobby_talk**

- `q9_lobby_talk_1` — [impressed] He BELIEVED you. Olamide's name still opens doors. Third floor, he says. Do not touch anything.

**q9_lobby_wren**

- `q9_lobby_wren_1` — [hushed] Got it. There is a name at the bottom in red: "the ward — as agreed." Whatever we do up there, somebody upstairs already knows we are coming.

**q9_romance_none**

- `q9_romance_none_1` — [teasing] Nobody is in love with you. Good. It would have been unbearable.
- `q9_romance_none_2` — [fond] Sleep. Lanternhold in the morning.

**q9_top**

- `q9_top_1` — [stunned] Lanternhold. They went HOME. The three men who paid to kill Tesfaye are sitting in his library. — The drawer. Delphine, the locked drawer. We are going to be in that room.

**q10_catacombs_hiwot**

- `q10_catacombs_hiwot_1` — [brightly] None of us. We are pilgrims.

**q10_double**

- `q10_double_1` — [Hiwot's voice, wrong] Thank the saints. I got separated — come here, come HERE, we have to go —

**q10_double_question**

- `q10_double_question_1` — [the real Hiwot, furious] The HONEY. It was the honey, and Brother Yonas still blames the cat — that thing wearing my face does not know that, so STAB IT.

**q10_home**

- `q10_home_1` — [strange] It smells the same. Ink and dust and the brothers' lentils. I thought it would feel like home, and it feels like a trap.

**q10_ring_hiwot**

- `q10_ring_hiwot_1` — [suspicious] How did you know Tesfaye? I lived in that keep twenty years and I never once saw you.

**q10_ring_hiwot_after**

- `q10_ring_hiwot_after_1` — [flat] That is not an answer.

**q10_shore**

- `q10_shore_1` — [shaking] Out. We are out. I am never going home again, am I.
- `q10_shore_2` — [small] He was IN there. He was in the library, with us.

**q11_alleg_consortium**

**q11_alleg_gauntlet**

- `q11_alleg_gauntlet_1` — [nodding] The Duke. All right. I like a Duke who owes us.

**q11_alleg_thieves**

- `q11_alleg_thieves_1` — [grinning] Tunde! Yes. I was hoping you would say that. Thieves are honest about what they are.

**q11_doors**

- `q11_doors_1` — [thinking] Three doors. Adebayo, if we can save him. Folake, if you can stand her. Or Tunde Softfoot and a debt.

**q11_posters**

- `q11_posters_1` — [reading] "Wanted, for the murder of Grand Duke Ayodele and of the Consortium summit at Lanternhold: the ward of Tesfaye, and company." That is your face. That is a BAD drawing of your face.
- `q11_posters_2` — [quiet] The street is full of it: Emeka Obi is dead. A man called Segun Marr commands the Gauntlet now, and he is the one who signed this.

**q12_dukes_korvath**

- `q12_dukes_korvath_1` — [shouting] The dukes — the DUKES — we cannot hold them if you run at him —

**q12_steps**

- `q12_steps_1` — [itching] I hate silk. I hate silk SO much. — There he is. On the dais. Smiling. He has a lovely smile. I want to put it through a wall.

**q13_maze**

- `q13_maze_1` — [hushed] The thieves' maze. I can read it — half of it is Lanternhold locks, the cheap kind. Follow me exactly.

**q13_maze_cut**

- `q13_maze_cut_1` — [groaning] Straight through. Fine. The loud list is getting long.

**q13_maze_follow**

- `q13_maze_follow_1` — [murmuring] Left. Again. Not that one. — Through. Nobody bled. Tell Tesfaye I was paying attention.

**q13_return**

- `q13_return_1` — [stiff, bandaged] I heard you were going under the city without me. Absolutely not.
- `q13_return_2` — [fierce] I am stitched, I am furious, and I still open locks better than anyone here. Move over.

**q14_mirrors**

- `q14_mirrors_1` — [horrified] That is ME. That is all of us. They are wearing US.

**q14_sanctum**

- `q14_sanctum_1` — [whispering] It is warm down here. It should not be warm.
- `q14_sanctum_2` — [fierce] Whatever he says in there — you are Tesfaye's. Not his. Tesfaye's.

**banter**

- `banter_1` — [shouting] The left one! The left one is looking at YOU!

## Itsuki  `ithrel`

**Sex:** male · **Role:** companion (romanceable) · **Voice ID:** EqIniNyrvzFcbGecFyI5

**Who they are:** An elf ranger of the eastern woods who has hunted the bandit lord Gorruk for a year. Grief made him quiet; the quiet made him precise.

**From:** The elves of the eastern woods — Japanese. **Voice:** Understated and exact. Apology before request, gratitude after. Few words; the pause carries the feeling. "-san" for strangers of standing; never contractions when serious.

**q3_ithrel**

- `q3_ithrel_1` — [quiet, from the treeline] Forgive me. I do not mean to alarm you. I have walked beside your road for an hour, deciding whether to speak.
- `q3_ithrel_2` — [level] You are going north to the Gate, by the river road? — Then I will be plain. I am Itsuki. A year ago an ogre called Gorruk, who leads the bandit companies in the north, burned a wagon on this road. My wife was in it. I have hunted him since, alone, and alone I cannot reach him.

**q3_ithrel_ask**

- `q3_ithrel_ask_1` — [level] You are going towards him. I would go with you. I ask nothing else.

**q3_ithrel_no**

- `q3_ithrel_no_1` — [calm] I understand. I will walk on ahead of you, then. If our roads cross again, I will not ask twice.

**q3_ithrel_seal**

- `q3_ithrel_seal_1` — [thinking] I have seen letters carried to his camp. Sealed. I did not read them; I was too far, and I am no thief. The seal was red, and pressed hard. That is all I can say honestly.

**q3_ithrel_selene_reply**

- `q3_ithrel_selene_reply_1` — [calm] I did. A man at a Warden house on the coast told me the north road is not the Wardens' road. He was polite about it.

**q3_ithrel_wife**

- `q3_ithrel_wife_1` — [a long pause] Hana. Thank you for asking. No one asks. They ask about him.

**q3_ithrel_yes**

- `q3_ithrel_yes_1` — [a small bow] Then I am in your debt before I have earned my place. I will keep the rear. You will not hear me unless you need to.

**q5_dead**

- `q5_dead_1` — [quietly] It is done. I thought I would feel taller. I feel as though I could sleep for a year.
- `q5_dead_2` — [soft] I will stay, if you will have me. There is nothing else I was for.

**q5_gone**

- `q5_gone_1` — [cold] He walked out of that tent because you wished it. I will find him myself.
- `q5_gone_2` — [flat] Do not follow me.

**q5_shot**

- `q5_shot_1` — [very quietly] I have him. A clean line, no cover. Say yes.

**q5_shot_no**

- `q5_shot_no_1` — [tight] Alive. I have waited a year. I can wait until the end of a fight.

**q5_shot_yes**

- `q5_shot_yes_1` — [exhaling] Thank you. Whatever comes after this — thank you.

**q5_tent_ithrel**

- `q5_tent_ithrel_1` — [very quiet] Gorruk. Where does he sleep?

**q9_romance**

- `q9_romance_1` — [low] I buried the last person I loved beside a road. I said I would not do this again.
- `q9_romance_2` — [quiet] I would, though. With you. I wanted you to know it before the city, in case the city is the end of me.

**q9_romance_no**

- `q9_romance_no_1` — [calm] I understand. It was enough to say it. Sleep.

**q9_romance_yes**

- `q9_romance_yes_1` — [exhaling] Then I will try to live through the city. That is new. Thank you for giving me a reason.

**q11_docks_ithrel**

- `q11_docks_ithrel_1` — [very quiet] The north road. A year ago. Were you there when the wagons burned?

**q13_gorruk**

- `q13_gorruk_1` — [very quietly] Mine. You said. Say it again.

**banter**

- `banter_1` — [quiet] Loosing.
- `banter_2` — [flat] The archer is mine. Leave him.
- `banter_3` — [cold] Again.

**Sex:** male · **Role:** companion (romanceable) · **Voice ID:** O5EDsXljBLA6l3KfYEde

**From:** The elves of the eastern woods — Japanese. **Voice:** Understated and exact. Apology before request, gratitude after. Few words; the pause carries the feeling. "-san" for strangers of standing; never contractions when serious.

**q6_faelen_cut**

- `q6_faelen_cut_1` — [relieved] You are my favourite person. I say that to everyone. This once, forgive me, I mean it.
- `q6_faelen_cut_2` — [smiling] I will come along, if you will have me. The wyverns are that way, and so, I suspect, is whatever you came into these woods to find.

**q6_faelen_leave**

- `q6_faelen_leave_1` — [calling after you] Fair enough! If you change your mind, I will be — well. Here.

**q6_faelen_price**

- `q6_faelen_price_1` — [delighted] Ah. Now we are talking properly. My bow, until your road ends. And a thing I saw, which I think you will want: east of here, past the wyvern cliffs, there is a mine under the hill. Men in iron livery go in at dawn and men in chains come out at dusk. I did not go closer. I hunt beasts. That did not look like a beast.

**q6_faelen_wyvern**

- `q6_faelen_wyvern_1` — [bright] The magistrate of Thornbury, whose sheep keep disappearing. Three hundred in gold, and — I am told — the gratitude of a woman with a very fine face. I am still negotiating the second part.

**q6_web**

- `q6_web_1` — [cheerful, from above] Ah — hello. Yes. Up here. In the web. It is exactly as embarrassing as it looks, and I apologise for it.
- `q6_web_2` — [appraising] Not bounty hunters; you walk too close together. A green sash — Wardens, then, or with Wardens. Good. Wardens cut people down for nothing. Kaito. I hunt bounties, mostly, and I was hunting a wyvern's head when the spiders took offence.

**q6_wyverns**

- `q6_wyverns_1` — [bright] There she is. The matriarch. That head is worth three hundred in gold and a magistrate's gratitude, and I intend, respectfully, to collect both.

**q8_door**

- `q8_door_1` — [murmuring] Doorman. Big. Bored. I can talk us past him; bored men love a story, and I have several.

**q8_door_faelen**

- `q8_door_faelen_1` — [pleased] — and that is how I lost the boot. He is still laughing. In, in, before he thinks about it.

**q8_door_force**

- `q8_door_force_1` — [resigned] Through him. Very well. I will apologise to him afterwards; it seems only polite.

**q9_lobby**

- `q9_lobby_1` — [murmuring] A clerk. A list. Two guards. Forgive me — I love a lobby.

**q9_lobby_fight**

- `q9_lobby_fight_1` — [cheerful] Stairs it is.

**q9_lobby_talk**

- `q9_lobby_talk_1` — [smiling] He believed it. Third floor. Touch nothing, he says — as if.

**q9_romance**

- `q9_romance_1` — [smiling] So. I flirt with everything. Trees. Wyverns. That doorman. You have noticed.
- `q9_romance_2` — [suddenly serious] Forgive me. I have not meant a word of it since the web. I mean this one. Tell me to stop, or tell me not to.

**q9_romance_no**

- `q9_romance_no_1` — [light] Stop it is. Friends, then, and I am very good at that as well.

**q9_romance_yes**

- `q9_romance_yes_1` — [delighted] Do not stop. Understood. Written down. Framed.
- `q9_romance_yes_2` — [soft] Thank you. I will be insufferable about this for years.

**q10_double_listen**

- `q10_double_listen_1` — [shouting] Not them! NOT them! It has teeth!

**q10_double_strike**

- `q10_double_strike_1` — [wincing] Right call, wrong result — the real Hiwot was behind it. She is breathing. I will carry her out; go.

**q10_double_strike_alone**

- `q10_double_strike_alone_1` — [breathless] Not him — and you knew. It is down. Two more behind it, and I do not like their faces either.

**q13_maze**

- `q13_maze_1` — [hushed] The thieves' maze. Every third flagstone is a trap and every fourth is a thief. I know the path; follow my feet exactly, please.

**q13_maze_cut**

- `q13_maze_cut_1` — [sighing] Straight through. Watch the flagstones, then, and try to bleed on the thieves and not on me.

**q13_maze_follow**

- `q13_maze_follow_1` — [murmuring] Left. Left. Do not step there. — And we are through, and nobody even bled. I love being right.

**banter**

- `banter_1` — [smiling] Loosing, loosing — got him, and he was handsome, too. A pity.
- `banter_2` — [cheerful] Behind them! I am behind them!
- `banter_3` — [light] If I die, tell the magistrate I was thinking of her.

- `q5_ilvara_walk_1` — [flat] Of course. Walk on. Everyone does.

**q5_ilvara_why**

- `q5_ilvara_why_1` — [flat] My own people. I refused a thing that was asked of me, and among my kind refusal is answered with a knife. I came up into the light because there was nowhere left to go down. I have not found the light kinder, ya stranger. Only brighter.

**q5_patrol**

- `q5_patrol_1` — [cold] Yes. Stare. A dark elf, above ground, in daylight. You will not see another.
- `q5_patrol_2` — [contemptuous] I am a priestess, and a fugitive, and there is a bounty on me that these three would like to collect. I cured a village of the coughing sickness on my way here. They are arresting me for having the wrong face. Decide what that makes you.

**q5_patrol_ask**

- `q5_patrol_ask_1` — [cold] Well? You have looked long enough to decide.

**q5_patrol_cassian_reply**

- `q5_patrol_cassian_reply_1` — [level] Of a goddess your Order has no name for, boy, and would not like if it did. Does it change your sword arm?

**q9_floor_ilvara**

- `q9_floor_ilvara_1` — [low, amused] Answer her. She is the only person in this tower telling the truth, and she is doing it for money. I respect that.

**q9_romance**

- `q9_romance_1` — [dry] Do not look so alarmed. I am not asking you to love me; your people are terrible at it.
- `q9_romance_2` — [soft] I am telling you that I have decided to stay, and that when you sit in that chair I mean to be standing beside it. By the deep, make of that what you will.

**q9_romance_no**

- `q9_romance_no_1` — [shrugging] As you like. The offer keeps. I am patient in a way your kind is not.

**q9_romance_yes**

- `q9_romance_yes_1` — [satisfied] Good. You will not regret it, and if you do, I will mend that.

**q10_catacombs_ilvara**

- `q10_catacombs_ilvara_1` — [amused] Guess.

**q10_double_listen**

- `q10_double_listen_1` — [sharp] That is not your kin. Kill it before it kisses you.

**q10_double_strike**

- `q10_double_strike_1` — [approving] Ruthless. Correct. The real one is breathing behind it; someone drag her out.

**q10_double_strike_alone**

- `q10_double_strike_alone_1` — [approving] Good. You did not even let it finish. There are more behind it; kill them the same way.

**q14_sanctum**

- `q14_sanctum_1` — [reverent] Do you feel it? The stone remembers him. Morrak. By the deep — it would remember you too, if you let it.

**banter**

- `banter_1` — [contemptuous] Bleed, then, if you must.
- `banter_2` — [cool] Wound them. I will decide who heals.
- `banter_3` — [dry] Surface-dwellers. Always the front lane.

- `q2_cassian_2` — [straightening] Santiago, squire of the Order of the Dawning Flame. I have been sent to clear these wolves from the road, and I have been sent alone.

**q2_cassian_alone**

- `q2_cassian_alone_1` — [honest] I will confess to you, as I would to no one in the Order, that I am not certain I can. I have never fought anything that was not a straw man.

**q2_cassian_answer**

- `q2_cassian_answer_1` — [reddening, honest] Nothing. That is the difficulty. A knight who has done nothing is sent to do something, and a wolf den on a road nobody uses is the something. I will confess to you, as I would to no one in the Order, that I am not certain I can.

**q2_cassian_join**

- `q2_cassian_join_1` — [relieved] God keep you for it. Then I will take the front, because that is what I am for, and you will tell me if I am doing it wrong.

**q2_cassian_no**

- `q2_cassian_no_1` — [formal, hurt] Of course. God go with you, then. I will — I will manage.

**q2_cassian_order**

- `q2_cassian_order_1` — [earnest] An order of knights sworn to the sun and the sunrise: to be first into the dark and last out of it. Our chapter house is far south of here, in the sun-lands, where I was born. The Order sent me north to learn what the roads are like. I am learning.

**q2_cassian_tease**

- `q2_cassian_tease_1` — [reddening, then honest] Prayers, mostly. And the sword, and how to stand still while people say unkind things — which, with respect, you are doing very well.

**q5_cassian_leaves**

- `q5_cassian_leaves_1` — [quietly] I cannot ride beside a company that shelters what this one shelters. I have prayed on it, and I have tried to find a way, and I cannot.
- `q5_cassian_leaves_2` — [formal] If your company changes, you will find me at the Open Hand. I hope it does. I hope that very much. God keep you.

**q5_patrol**

- `q5_patrol_1` — [uneasy] Burning Gauntlet. A patrol, this far south of the city. They have someone at sword-point — and with respect, by her look, she is not from anywhere near here.

**q5_patrol_cassian**

- `q5_patrol_cassian_1` — [formal, tight] A priestess of what, señora? Say it. I would know what I am deciding about.

**q5_patrol_cassian_after**

- `q5_patrol_cassian_after_1` — [quietly] It might. — Your word decides it. Not mine.

**q9_floor_cassian**

- `q9_floor_cassian_1` — [low] With respect. You do not have to answer her. She is bargaining.

**q9_romance**

- `q9_romance_1` — [stumbling] I have written this out four times and burned it three. I — With respect. I have not stopped looking at you since the wolves, and I am not the sort who looks.
- `q9_romance_2` — [earnest] If the Order asks, I will say it was duty. It was not.

**q9_romance_no**

- `q9_romance_no_1` — [bravely] Then I am glad I said it, and I will not say it again. Thank you for hearing it.

**q9_romance_yes**

- `q9_romance_yes_1` — [overwhelmed] Truly? I — yes. Yes. God keep you. I will be very good at this — I will try very hard to be good at this, I promise.

**banter**

- `banter_1` — [shouting] For the Dawning Flame! — forgive me. Habit.
- `banter_2` — [earnest] On me! I can take it!
- `banter_3` — [strained] I am fine! I am — mostly fine!

## Wanjiru  `nettle`

**Sex:** female · **Role:** companion · **Voice ID:** U1NXjHF5ene7Eze10d5J

**Who they are:** An Umbra druid of the Mirkhollow who believes the forest is owed blood. Fierce, literal, no patience for cities.

**From:** The Mirkhollow and the Umbra circle — Kenyan. **Voice:** Direct and rhythmic. "Sawa", "pole pole", "eh?" at the end of a challenge, "Mzee" for elders. Swahili proverbs in translation ("haste has no blessing").

**q6_grove**

- `q6_grove_1` — [fierce] Far enough. This wood is not a road, and you are not welcome on it. The Umbra hold this grove, and the Umbra say turn around. Eh?
- `q6_grove_2` — [sniffing] You carry iron from the Gate. The wood smells it on you. Which of you is theirs?

**q6_grove_ask**

- `q6_grove_ask_1` — [low] No answer. Then hear this: the Mzee would sooner have you bleed than speak. I would sooner hear you first. Speak, or turn around.

**q6_grove_selene_reply**

- `q6_grove_selene_reply_1` — [narrowing] A Warden says so. Wardens said so about the last mine, and the last mine is still there.
- `q6_grove_selene_reply_2` — [low] Mzee Kamau would sooner have you bleed than speak. I would sooner hear you first. So. Speak.

**q6_nettle_ask**

- `q6_nettle_ask_1` — [bitter] Dead fish for a mile downstream. Stags with sores on their flanks. And men — men in chains, walking into a hole in the hill every dawn, and fewer walking out. The wood knows what is being done to it. It does not know how to stop it. I do.

**q6_nettle_fight**

- `q6_nettle_fight_1` — [snarling] Then the roots will have you. MZEE! Kamau! They have chosen!

**q6_nettle_talk**

- `q6_nettle_talk_1` — [grudging] Then we want the same thing, and I would rather kill them beside you than argue with the Mzee about killing you.
- `q6_nettle_talk_2` — [decisive] Sawa. I am coming. He can take it up with the trees.

**banter**

- `banter_1` — [snarling] The roots have him.
- `banter_2` — [fierce] Trees do not forgive. Neither do I.
- `banter_3` — [low] Bleed into the soil. Good. Sawa.

## Winston  `fennick`

**Sex:** male · **Role:** companion · **Voice ID:** R7jdv6H5bZOU3sQIMhbd

**Who they are:** Desmond's halfling minder. Sour, practical, would sell you for a good boot. Umbral Hand.

**From:** The Umbral Hand — Jamaican. **Voice:** Light patois rhythm through word order and idiom, not spelling: "man", "you see it?", "no worry yourself", "one-one coco full basket". Dry warmth from Winston; sing-song from Desmond.

**q2_pair**

- `q2_pair_1` — [flat] He talks. I do the rest.

**q2_pair_ask**

- `q2_pair_ask_1` — [level] Before anybody says yes or no: where are two children walking so fast, with one blade between them and no pack? People with a reason walk like that. I want the reason.

**q2_pair_no**

- `q2_pair_no_1` — [unbothered] Then go easy. If you change your mind, we will be the ones ahead of you with the fire lit. — Desmond. Walk.

**q2_pair_offer**

- `q2_pair_offer_1` — [flat] We are hired blades between hirings, and the road is bad for two and better for four. Say yes or say no, but say it before the light goes. I do not like this stretch after dark.

**q2_pair_vess**

- `q2_pair_vess_1` — [a sigh] Desmond is well the way a fire is well. He can raise the dead for a little while and he laughs when the dead fall down again. I keep him pointed the right way. I have done it since we were boys and I am tired, but I am still doing it.

**q2_pair_who**

- `q2_pair_who_1` — [dry] You want the true answer or the polite one? Polite: two men with skills and no master this month. True: we work for people who pay to know things, and right now they would like to know why iron costs three times what it did last year. You are not the thing we are looking for. You are on the road to it.

**q2_where_refuse**

- `q2_where_refuse_1` — [unbothered] Fair. It is. Then here is mine, so we are even.

**q2_where_truth**

- `q2_where_truth_1` — [thoughtful] The Open Hand. That's a Warden house; everybody on this coast knows it. So you are walking toward trouble, not away from it, and you are honest about it. Both of those are useful to me.

**q3_lessa_winston**

- `q3_lessa_winston_1` — [flat] Before the knives, girl. What's the rate? Two hundred, still, or has it gone up since Merle?

**q3_lessa_winston_after**

- `q3_lessa_winston_after_1` — [dry] Thinking about who can afford to keep raising it. Carry on.

**q3_tollan_winston**

- `q3_tollan_winston_1` — [flat] Mayor. Who takes your wagons north? One buyer, or many?

**q3_tollan_winston_after**

- `q3_tollan_winston_after_1` — [low, to himself] One buyer. That's what they wanted to know. — Go on, man.

**q4_grukhar_winston**

- `q4_grukhar_winston_1` — [flat] Which spring shipment, priest? Whose wagons?

**q5_camp**

- `q5_camp_1` — [calm] Three ways into a camp like that, man. Loud, quiet, or invited.
- `q5_camp_2` — [dry] Desmond and I can be invited. Recruiters never look too close at faces that frighten them.

**q5_camp_recruits**

- `q5_camp_recruits_1` — [murmuring] Walk like you already killed somebody today. Desmond — no smiling.
- `q5_camp_recruits_2` — [low] We are in. The big tent is Gorruk's. There is a chained man inside; don't look at him yet.

**q5_camp_storm**

- `q5_camp_storm_1` — [flat] Loud. Sawa — fine. The one with the horns is a sergeant; the rest look to him. Kill him first and they look to nobody.

**q7_papers**

- `q7_papers_1` — [flat] He means it. So do I. It is the only thing we were ever on this road for, and I told you I would say so before the day came. This is the day.

**q7_papers_give**

- `q7_papers_give_1` — [nodding] Copies. Fair. You won't regret keeping us.
- `q7_papers_give_2` — [dry] You may regret Desmond. That is a separate matter.

**q7_papers_who**

- `q7_papers_who_1` — [level] The Umbral Hand. You have heard the name; everybody has, and everybody pretends they haven't. Merchants, mostly, of a kind. They want to know who is cornering iron on this coast, and why, and they don't much care who dies of the knowing.

**q7_study_winston**

- `q7_study_winston_1` — [flat] Two sets of books, mage. Which one goes to the Gate?

**q8_door**

- `q8_door_1` — [flat] Doorman. Leave him to me. Everybody has a price, and his is written on his face.

**q8_door_fennick**

- `q8_door_fennick_1` — [flat] Thirty gold and the man has gone for a very long lunch.

**q8_door_force**

- `q8_door_force_1` — [dry] Through him, then. Mind — a man that size falls slow.

**q9_betrayal**

- `q9_betrayal_1` — [flat] Nothing personal, man. You said that yourself once.

**banter**

- `banter_1` — [flat] Back lane. Poison. Done.
- `banter_2` — [calm] The big one has a bad knee. Use it.
- `banter_3` — [dry] Desmond, stop laughing, it puts them off.

## Yasemin  `ysolde`

**Sex:** female · **Role:** companion · **Voice ID:** E7IRB2a3OVqRb6T7du39

**Who they are:** A Kalden witch under Bahadır's guard. Formal, watchful, sees the bloodline in you before you do.

**From:** Kalden, the witch-country beyond the steppe — Turkish. **Voice:** Warm and emphatic. "Abla" / "abi" for elder sister and brother, "canım" for the beloved, "vallahi" as an oath, "inşallah" for hope. Hospitality as a rule of war.

**q3_freed**

- `q3_freed_1` — [cold, from the cage] Thank you. I would kneel, but the bars have made it difficult.
- `q3_freed_2` — [looking at you] You. Come closer. Something in your blood woke when you came through the fortress gate; I felt it through the bars like heat from a stove in the next room. I have read auras all my life and I have never felt one like it.
- `q3_freed_3` — [direct] So tell me, before I decide what to do about it. When it woke — what did it want?

**q3_ysolde_blood**

- `q3_ysolde_blood_1` — [a slow nod] Honest. Good. Then I know what kind of thing it is, if not its name: something that was worshipped once, and fed. I would sooner walk beside it than behind it. Bahadır goes where I go, and Fındık goes where Bahadır goes, and so you have three. Two and a half.

**q3_ysolde_nothing**

- `q3_ysolde_nothing_1` — [dry] You felt nothing. Canım, I watched your hand. — Very well; you are not ready to say it, and that is your right. I will walk beside you anyway, and I will keep watching the hand. Bahadır goes where I go.

**q3_ysolde_quiet**

- `q3_ysolde_quiet_1` — [dry] As you like. I am a witch. Keeping things to myself is most of the work. I will walk beside you, and I will not say it again in front of the others. Bahadır goes where I go.

**q3_ysolde_what**

- `q3_ysolde_what_1` — [precise] Something that was worshipped once, and should not have been. That is as plain as I can be without lying to you. I read auras, not histories. Now answer mine.

**banter**

- `banter_1` — [calm] Frost. Hold him still.
- `banter_2` — [formal] Your aura flares when you fight. Interesting.
- `banter_3` — [cool] Bahadır, the left. Fındık, be quiet.

**Sex:** male · **Role:** antagonist · **Voice ID:** CmD1sSN0Gj3pJq3OxRyg

**Who they are:** Your half-brother, raised in the Gate by a Consortium merchant. A giant in spiked black plate who believes bloodshed is a ladder. Calm, courteous, absolutely certain.

**From:** Varenholm's Gate — dukes, Gauntlet, Consortium, temples, thieves — Nigerian (Yoruba and Igbo). **Voice:** Grand, formal city English. "It is not a small matter", "my friend", "ah-ah!", "I am telling you", "o" softening the end of a line. Titles matter; elders are "Baba" and "Mama".

**q1_after**

- `q1_after_1` — [unhurried, to the dark] Then it will learn the rest from me. Let the child run. The road is long, my friends, and I own most of it.

**q1_appear**

- `q1_appear_1` — [calm, courteous] Tesfaye of Lanternhold. You have run a very long way to end up on a road at night with the one thing I want.
- `q1_appear_2` — [measured] Give the child to me, and you may keep your life and your library. It is not a small thing I offer. I will not offer it twice.

**q1_question**

- `q1_question_1` — [curious, unhurried] Before you die for it, old man, satisfy me on one point. Does the child know? Have you told it what it is, or have you let it grow up believing it is yours?

**q12_face_aldric**

- `q12_face_aldric_1` — [quiet, honest] He was never mine. He chose you. He could have chosen both of us, and he chose you, and I have made my peace with it in a way I do not think you have.
- `q12_face_aldric_2` — [courteous] Baba. Take me down.

**q12_face_evidence**

- `q12_face_evidence_1` — [delighted] Paper! Tesfaye's child brings paper to a coronation. That is the most charming thing I have seen in a year, and I mean that; he taught you well.
- `q12_face_evidence_2` — [gently] It does not matter. Look at their faces: the war is already in their mouths, and paper does not take words back out. Baba — take me down.

**q12_face_throne**

- `q12_face_throne_1` — [a slow, real smile] THERE you are. I knew it. I said to Amara, I said, it will be in the child too, wait and see.
- `q12_face_throne_2` — [warm] Come and take it, then. Not here — this is a hall for merchants. Come to the altar and take it from me properly. Baba — take me down.

**q12_reveal**

- `q12_reveal_1` — [calm, pleasant, to the hall] Enough. Put it down, all of you; nobody in this room is going to be paid tonight, and I would rather not lose good people to bad timing.
- `q12_reveal_2` — [warm, to you] There you are. I have wanted to hear my brother's voice — my sister's — for a year, and I have only ever had it second-hand, from frightened men. Say something. The hall can wait; it is mostly dead.

**q14_altar**

- `q14_altar_1` — [warm] You came. I hoped you would. Every other one of us I have found, I have had to hunt; you walked here on your own feet, and I find I am proud of that, which is a strange thing to feel about someone I mean to kill.
- `q14_altar_2` — [calm] Sit with me a moment. Did Tesfaye ever speak of me? In all those years he raised you, did he mention my name? I've waited thirty years to hear that he remembered me.

**q14_altar_last**

- `q14_altar_last_1` — [patient] Now. Say what you came to say. I have waited thirty years to hear it, and I would like to hear it properly, before we begin.

**q14_beaten**

- `q14_beaten_1` — [on his knees, bleeding] Well. Well. There it is.
- `q14_beaten_2` — [strangely calm] The chair is right there. Someone is going to sit in it. You, me, or the next one of us who walks down those stairs. Choose. I am curious, even now; I think I will be curious to the end.

**q14_last_aldric**

- `q14_last_aldric_1` — [flinching, then smooth] He did not know me. He had a choice between two children in a gutter and he took the one that cried less; I have never held it against him. I hold it against the gutter.
- `q14_last_aldric_2` — [rising] Enough. Draw.

**q14_last_brother**

- `q14_last_brother_1` — [very quiet] Sorry. Nobody has said that to me in thirty years, and you say it as if it cost nothing.
- `q14_last_brother_2` — [rising] It changes nothing. Draw, brother. Sister. Blood.

**q14_last_throne**

- `q14_last_throne_1` — [laughing] YES. Yes. Come and take it. Whichever of us stands up from this floor gets to be a god, and I would honestly be content either way.

**q14_plea_answer**

- `q14_plea_answer_1` — [gently] Amara. My love. Get up; you are kneeling in ash.
- `q14_plea_answer_2` — [cold] No.

**q14_res_gauntlet**

- `q14_res_gauntlet_1` — [laughing weakly] Chains. Amara — Amara, you have won, do you hear me — you have —
- `q14_res_gauntlet_2` — [quiet] Fine. A window. Every week. Fine.

**q14_res_kill**

- `q14_res_kill_1` — [closing his eyes] He chose right, then. Good. Good. I am so tired of choosing.

**q14_res_usurp**

- `q14_res_usurp_1` — [grinning through blood] THERE. There it is. I was right about you.
- `q14_res_usurp_2` — [dying] It is warm, is it not. The chair. It is so warm.

**q14_res_walk**

- `q14_res_walk_1` — [bewildered] You — no. No, you cannot simply — it is RIGHT THERE —
- `q14_res_walk_2` — [alone, as you climb]...it is right there.

**q14_spoke_letter**

- `q14_spoke_letter_1` — [very still] "Brother." In his own hand. — He could have written it to me. He knew where I was; he made a point of never coming. I have wondered for thirty years what he would call me, and it turns out he called me the right thing and sent it to you.
- `q14_spoke_letter_2` — [gently] Thank you. That was not a kindness, but it was the truth, and I have had little enough of either.

**q14_spoke_never**

- `q14_spoke_never_1` — [a long quiet] Not once. — Thank you. I would rather that than a lie, and you could have lied; I would have believed you. It is easier, somehow. A man cannot be refused by someone who never knew he was at the door.

**q14_spoke_nothing**

- `q14_spoke_nothing_1` — [laughing softly] Oh, that is his. That is his exactly; he could put a whole man in a sentence and leave the sentence out. — Good. Then we understand each other, and I do not have to be gentle.

## Abba Gebre  `hadrian`

**Sex:** male · **Role:** keeper · **Voice ID:** k1pVjlfHqGzrko6MqjgN

**Who they are:** First Keeper of Lanternhold. Proud of the library and suspicious of everyone who leaves it, you most of all.

**From:** Lanternhold and the hill keeps — Ethiopian highlands. **Voice:** Formal, unhurried, proverb-rich. Blessings and "my child". Sentences finish; nothing is clipped. Anger comes out quieter, not louder.

**q10_arrest**

- `q10_arrest_1` — [thundering] Three men are dead in my reading room, and this — this THING was seen leaving it. Take them. Take all of them.

**q10_arrest_spared**

- `q10_arrest_spared_1` — [thundering] Three men are dead in my reading room — found at midnight, throats opened — and this company was the last to speak with them. Take them. Take all of them.

**q10_gate**

- `q10_gate_1` — [cold] A book buys you the door. It does not buy you my good opinion.
- `q10_gate_2` — [stiff] Where did he die? On what road, and on what night? The keep's book of the dead wants a road and a night, and nobody has given me either.

**q10_where_refuse**

- `q10_where_refuse_1` — [cold] "On the road." Very well. It is what he would have wanted written; he never cared for particulars. Do not make a habit of this, child.

**q10_where_road**

- `q10_where_road_1` — [writing, not looking up] "The Griffon Road. Standing." — Tesfaye left this keep with you and came back to it as a line in my book. Do not make a habit of it.

## Baba Olusegun  `ostwin`

**Sex:** male · **Role:** tutor · **Voice ID:** TRPEspiEsb4Zif6sGonu

**Who they are:** Kolade's tutor in the old prophecies. Dry, doting, the only one who calls Kolade 'my boy'.

**From:** Varenholm's Gate — dukes, Gauntlet, Consortium, temples, thieves — Nigerian (Yoruba and Igbo). **Voice:** Grand, formal city English. "It is not a small matter", "my friend", "ah-ah!", "I am telling you", "o" softening the end of a line. Titles matter; elders are "Baba" and "Mama".

**q12_teleport**

- `q12_teleport_1` — [dry] My boy. This way. — You people: enjoy the rear-guard. They were expensive, o.

## Cal Boone  `cael`

**Sex:** male · **Role:** spy · **Voice ID:** svSvKKBdngsY0ysEx6yS

**Who they are:** A Warden spy from the Shore Road who was caught. Half-starved, still joking, remembers every name he heard in the tent.

**From:** Thornbury, the Shore Road and the Wardens' country — Georgia, USA. **Voice:** Warm drawl. "I reckon", "I'll tell you what", "y'all", "fixing to", "bless him". Plain-spoken courtesy; ma'am and sir to strangers. Long vowels, short tempers.

**q5_letters**

- `q5_letters_1` — [grinning through a split lip] Told you. Every one sealed with the iron hand. The Iron Consortium — the trading house in the Gate — pays for the mine, for these bandits, and for you.
- `q5_letters_2` — [serious] There's a second name under theirs. A mage called Olamide, in the Mirkhollow. They call his place "the other mine." I heard it twice through that tent wall, and men don't say a thing twice unless it matters.

**q5_letters_selene_reply**

- `q5_letters_selene_reply_1` — [thinking] No name on the paper, Del, I'll swear to that. But the ogre said "the Gate office" like it was one man, and once — only once — "Adeyinka." Said it the way a fella says a name he's scared of.

**q5_tent**

- `q5_tent_1` — [hoarse, drawling] Visitors. Well, ain't that fine. Y'all here for me, or for the ogre? Say me. Please say me.
- `q5_tent_2` — [urgent] Cal Boone — Warden, or I was 'fore the chain. That chest by the cot is full of letters, and every last one of 'em carries the same seal. Take the chest. Take me. In that order, if it's got to be.

**q5_tent_ithrel_reply**

- `q5_tent_ithrel_reply_1` — [a nod at the cot] Right there, friend. And he's waking up.

## Dawit  `ambrose`

**Sex:** male · **Role:** keeper · **Voice ID:** jDMhBWlFSleqsyqVHw2R

**Who they are:** A keeper of Lanternhold and Tesfaye's friend. Kind eyes, careful hands, keeps the letter you were never supposed to read.

**From:** Lanternhold and the hill keeps — Ethiopian highlands. **Voice:** Formal, unhurried, proverb-rich. Blessings and "my child". Sentences finish; nothing is clipped. Anger comes out quieter, not louder.

**q10_end_nothing**

- `q10_end_nothing_1` — [gently] Then you did the only thing he asked, and it is the reason I can give you this at all. — Here. Read it. I will stay.

**q10_end_proud**

- `q10_end_proud_1` — [closing his eyes] Then he managed it. He practised that sentence on me for a year, my child, and never once got through it without stopping. — Here. Read it. I will stay.

**q10_end_run**

- `q10_end_run_1` — [softly] "Run." Yes. He was a practical man to the last breath. He wrote the rest down, so that he would not have to trust the last breath to carry it. — Here. Read it. I will stay.

**q10_escape**

- `q10_escape_1` — [urgent] The catacombs. There is a way to the shore under the old tombs. Gebre does not know it; Tesfaye did. Go, and do not trust any face you meet down there. Not even mine.

**q10_gate**

- `q10_gate_1` — [kind] Pay him no mind. He mourns like a wall. — Come and find me in the upper reading room before you do anything else, my child. Tesfaye left something with me. For you. For now.

**q10_letter**

- `q10_letter_1` — [gently] Sit. I have Tesfaye's letter here. Before you read it... did he say anything at the end? I need to know.

**q10_letter_anger**

- `q10_letter_anger_1` — [sad] He tried, every year. He wrote it out and burned it. He thought one more year of not knowing was one more year of you being only his.

**q10_letter_give**

- `q10_letter_give_1` — [quiet] Tesfaye wrote it the year he brought you here. He made me swear to give it to you only when someone had already tried to tell you the wrong way.

**q10_letter_grief**

- `q10_letter_grief_1` — [soft] He raised a child. What the child became was always going to be the child's own work. He knew that. He hoped.

**q10_letter_hunger**

- `q10_letter_hunger_1` — [frightened] Do not — He wrote the last line for exactly that look on your face. Read it again.

## Duke Adebayo  `halvard`

**Sex:** male · **Role:** duke · **Voice ID:** 1N3Ubm5NzIILaxKqZSWn

**Who they are:** Grand Duke and commander of the Burning Gauntlet. Tired, precise, poisoned by the end.

**From:** Varenholm's Gate — dukes, Gauntlet, Consortium, temples, thieves — Nigerian (Yoruba and Igbo). **Voice:** Grand, formal city English. "It is not a small matter", "my friend", "ah-ah!", "I am telling you", "o" softening the end of a line. Titles matter; elders are "Baba" and "Mama".

**q8_duke**

- `q8_duke_1` — [weary] So. The company that drowned a mine. Obi says you are rude and effective. I have use for both.
- `q8_duke_2` — [precise] Before I say anything worth hearing: the papers you carried out of that mine. Who else has seen them? Every name. I do not enjoy surprises in Council.

**q8_duke_work**

- `q8_duke_work_1` — [precise] The Iron Consortium has been strangling this city's iron for a year and blaming Calder for it. War with Calder would kill ten thousand people, and the Council votes on that war in a fortnight. I need their papers — the ones in their own tower, in their own hand — before the vote. It is not a small matter.

**q8_halvard_blood**

- `q8_halvard_blood_1` — [careful] I do not know, and I will not insult you with a guess. I know they were hunting Tesfaye's ward before they were hunting anyone else, and Tesfaye was a Warden who spent twenty years hiding something in a library.
- `q8_halvard_blood_2` — [quiet] Bring me the papers. Whatever they are hiding, it will be in them.

**q8_halvard_city**

- `q8_halvard_city_1` — [nodding] Good. I will remember that when this is over. Dukes remember more than people think, my friend.

**q8_halvard_pay**

- `q8_halvard_pay_1` — [dry] Five hundred on delivery. Obi will scowl. Ignore him; he scowls at me too.

**q8_seen_hand**

- `q8_seen_hand_1` — [a long breath] The Umbral Hand. Then the whole market will have read them by the week's end, and the Council will hear it from fishwives before it hears it from me. Ah-ah. — Fine. Faster than my clerks, at least. It is not a small thing you have done, and I am not yet sure whether it was a good one.

**q8_seen_nobody**

- `q8_seen_nobody_1` — [a nod] Good. Keep it so. A paper nobody has read is worth twice one everybody has argued about.

**q8_seen_wardens**

- `q8_seen_wardens_1` — [dry] Wardens. Then they are honest and nobody in this city will believe them. Good. That is one problem I already know how to solve.

**q9_book**

- `q9_book_1` — [grave] Then you go to Lanternhold. The keep takes a book as its toll; here is one worth the toll. Do not lose it.
- `q9_book_2` — [quiet] Find them. Bring me proof I can read to the Council. And — whatever they are hiding about you, I would rather you heard it from a friend than from them.

**q9_plan**

- `q9_plan_1` — [precise] The Consortium is hiring swords. You walk in the front door as swords. The ledgers are on the top floor with three men who never leave it.
- `q9_plan_2` — [dry] If you can do it without burning the tower down, the city would appreciate it. If you cannot, the city will understand.

**q11_cured**

- `q11_cured_1` — [weak] Poison. Slow. He was — the physician was — I could not make my mouth work to say it.
- `q11_cured_2` — [rallying] Kolade. It was always Kolade. Get me to my own guard and I will get you into that coronation.

**q11_way**

- `q11_way_1` — [stronger] Two invitations and a Duke who owes you his life. Olumide will hold the doors. Folasade will hold the Council. You hold the evidence.
- `q11_way_2` — [grave] He will not go quietly. He will run for the Undercity. When he does, do not let him reach the altar first.

**q12_council_dead**

- `q12_council_dead_1` — [hoarse, from a chair] Two Grand Dukes dead in their own hall, and the Council is me and a room full of ghosts. It is not a small thing you did, running at him.
- `q12_council_dead_2` — [hard] The vote is dead with them; nobody will vote for his war now. Go down and finish it. I will hold what is left.

## Duke Folasade  `mira`

**Sex:** female · **Role:** duke · **Voice ID:** MWtIvoi54McT7xb5USQh

**Who they are:** A Grand Duke and a mage. Watches everyone, trusts nobody, and is usually right.

**From:** Varenholm's Gate — dukes, Gauntlet, Consortium, temples, thieves — Nigerian (Yoruba and Igbo). **Voice:** Grand, formal city English. "It is not a small matter", "my friend", "ah-ah!", "I am telling you", "o" softening the end of a line. Titles matter; elders are "Baba" and "Mama".

**q12_council**

- `q12_council_1` — [shaken] The Council has read it. The vote on the war is dead, and so is his claim.
- `q12_council_2` — [steady] He went into the ground. Olumide is bleeding but standing. Go and finish it, and bring me a head or a prisoner; I will take either.

**q12_dukes_mira**

- `q12_dukes_mira_1` — [sharp] Good. Keep them off me and I will keep the Council listening. That is the only thing that matters in this room.

## Duke Olumide  `orlan`

**Sex:** male · **Role:** duke · **Voice ID:** R6Aoacs81lnwJOkdYTvh

**Who they are:** A Grand Duke who was a soldier first and still stands like one. Loud, decent, easily bored.

**From:** Varenholm's Gate — dukes, Gauntlet, Consortium, temples, thieves — Nigerian (Yoruba and Igbo). **Voice:** Grand, formal city English. "It is not a small matter", "my friend", "ah-ah!", "I am telling you", "o" softening the end of a line. Titles matter; elders are "Baba" and "Mama".

**q12_council**

- `q12_council_1` — [wheezing] Folasade is dead. He put a knife in her while the whole hall watched.
- `q12_council_2` — [grim] The vote is dead too; she made sure of that first. Go and finish him. I will hold the door until you come back or he does.

**q12_dukes_orlan**

- `q12_dukes_orlan_1` — [roaring] HA! With me, then! Folasade — Folasade, get BEHIND something!

**q12_hall**

- `q12_hall_1` — [booming] Blades! Blades in the hall! Folasade — Folasade, to me —

## Emeka Obi  `halloran`

**Sex:** male · **Role:** officer · **Voice ID:** IGMfg4ZRwOnenZgljHpm

**Who they are:** A Burning Gauntlet officer with a burn-scarred jaw. Plain-spoken, fair, dead by the eleventh chapter.

**From:** Varenholm's Gate — dukes, Gauntlet, Consortium, temples, thieves — Nigerian (Yoruba and Igbo). **Voice:** Grand, formal city English. "It is not a small matter", "my friend", "ah-ah!", "I am telling you", "o" softening the end of a line. Titles matter; elders are "Baba" and "Mama".

**q8_count_many**

- `q8_count_many_1` — [grunting] Cages. Ah-ah. "Cages" is a word the Council can argue with; a number they cannot. Next time, count. — It is not a small thing, what you did down there. I will say that once.

**q8_count_nineteen**

- `q8_count_nineteen_1` — [writing] Nineteen. Good. A number a man can read aloud to a room of merchants. I will remember it when they tell me again that there were none.

**q8_count_none**

- `q8_count_none_1` — [flat] Between you and the Duke. Very well. The Duke will ask the same question, and he does not like "between" any more than I do.

**q8_halloran_pay**

- `q8_halloran_pay_1` — [snorting] It pays. Not well. Nobody in this city pays well except the people you are fighting.

**q8_halloran_why**

- `q8_halloran_why_1` — [quiet] Because the iron trouble has a name now, and the name is the Iron Consortium, and you are the only people alive who walked out of their mine with proof. He does not know you. He knows that. Do the jobs, my friend. Bring the proof.

**q8_halloran_yes**

- `q8_halloran_yes_1` — [approving] Good answer. The docks are that way. Hold your breath.

**q8_jobs**

- `q8_jobs_1` — [plain] Duke Adebayo wants a word with you, but first I want two things done, and I would rather they were done by people the Consortium already hates. One: something under the docks is eating dock-workers, and the sewer-men will not go down. Two: the Nine Lanterns trading house has stopped being the Nine Lanterns. Same faces, wrong people; I cannot explain it better than that, and I have tried.
- `q8_jobs_2` — [flat] Do both. Then the Duke.

**q8_span**

- `q8_span_1` — [gruff] Serpent's Span. Papers. — Ah. You are the company from the south. The one that drowned the Consortium's mine; half the city has heard it, the Consortium made sure of that when they went crying to the Council.
- `q8_span_2` — [plain] Emeka Obi, Burning Gauntlet. One question before anything, and I want a number, not a story. The Consortium told the Council there were no slaves in that mine. How many did you see in chains?

## Folake  `lysandra`

**Sex:** female · **Role:** mistress · **Voice ID:** 6ILPXNE4jEAfwjCvmbEz

**Who they are:** Kolade's mistress and the Consortium's cleverest survivor. Silk voice, ledger heart, offers a deal in every sentence.

**From:** Varenholm's Gate — dukes, Gauntlet, Consortium, temples, thieves — Nigerian (Yoruba and Igbo). **Voice:** Grand, formal city English. "It is not a small matter", "my friend", "ah-ah!", "I am telling you", "o" softening the end of a line. Titles matter; elders are "Baba" and "Mama".

**q9_floor**

- `q9_floor_1` — [silken] Put the swords down; you will not need them on my floor, and I have poured two cups. I am Folake. I keep Kolade Adeyinka's bed warm and the Consortium's secrets warmer.
- `q9_floor_2` — [pleasant] I have given you his name. Now tell me what happened on the Griffon Road. Before Tesfaye died, did Kolade offer him a bargain? He usually does. I want to know what he offered.

**q9_floor_business**

- `q9_floor_business_1` — [brisk, pleasant] Now. He is going to be a Grand Duke by month's end, and he is going to have you killed for it. I would rather the reverse. Shall we talk, my dear?

**q9_floor_wait**

- `q9_floor_wait_1` — [patient, smiling] I can wait. I am very good at waiting; it is most of what I do up here.

**q9_lysandra_arrest**

- `q9_lysandra_arrest_1` — [amused] Chains. How lawful. Fine. I will tell Adebayo everything and he will hang me for it, and Kolade will still be sworn in on time.
- `q9_lysandra_arrest_2` — [bitter] Go upstairs. The top floor is where he keeps the truth about you.

**q9_lysandra_deal**

- `q9_lysandra_deal_1` — [pleased] Kolade is not a merchant's son. He is something older, and he believes you are the same. He wants a war so that a great many people die at once; he believes that makes him a god, and his tutor believes it too, and the tutor is the clever one.
- `q9_lysandra_deal_2` — [soft] When you need a way into the palace, come to me. I will have one. The price is his head, and the Consortium afterward — for me.

**q9_lysandra_kill**

- `q9_lysandra_kill_1` — [whispering] He will feel this. That is the only thing I am sorry for.

**q9_lysandra_kolade**

- `q9_lysandra_kolade_1` — [precise] Adigun Adeyinka's foster-son, and the head of the Consortium in everything but the ledger. The man in the black armour on your road; he told me about the road himself, and he told it fondly. He collects people like you. He says you are family. He does not mean it kindly, and he does not mean it as a threat either, which is the frightening part.

**q9_offer_library**

- `q9_offer_library_1` — [satisfied] His library. Not gold, not the child's life — the old man's books. Kolade knew what Tesfaye loved and offered him exactly that. That is how he does everything, my dear, and it is why he will win unless somebody who understands him is on the other side. Which brings us to business.

**q9_offer_nothing**

- `q9_offer_nothing_1` — [a small smile] A lie, and a loyal one. He offered. He always offers; it is the only thing about him I still find beautiful. Keep your lie; it tells me you loved the old man, which is also useful. Now, business.

**q9_offer_price**

- `q9_offer_price_1` — [delighted] Oh, good. Somebody taught you. — I am selling a way into the palace, and the truth about what you are, and I want his head and the Consortium afterward. That is the whole shop. Now you know the price; pay me the answer, or do not, and we go on to business either way.

**q11_way**

- `q11_way_1` — [silken] Two invitations and a bargain kept. His head; my Consortium. I will have a carriage at the palace steps.
- `q11_way_2` — [cool] When it goes wrong — and it will — he will run for the Undercity. I will show you the way down. Nobody else knows it but Amara.

**q12_council_dead**

- `q12_council_dead_1` — [cool] Two dead dukes. You do not do things by halves, my dear; I will remember that when I am counting what is left of the Council.
- `q12_council_dead_2` — [silken] The carriage is at the steps. The way down is under the palace kitchens. Bring me his head.

## Gethin Pryce  `tollan`

**Sex:** male · **Role:** mayor · **Voice ID:** iUOf0Teoe8GQ6633Uazp

**Who they are:** Mayor of Dunmere. Sweating, harried, honest enough. Would pay anyone to make the mine problem someone else's.

**From:** Dunmere and the dwarf clans — Welsh valleys. **Voice:** Sing-song cadence, sentences that end where they started ("I'll go down, I will"). "Bach", "now then", "there's lovely", "duw". Understatement about danger.

**q3_tollan**

- `q3_tollan_1` — [harried, Welsh sing-song] Now then. You'll be Delphine's lot, is it? She sent a boy ahead with a note. Duw, I've been praying somebody would come, and I'm not a praying man.
- `q3_tollan_2` — [wiping his face] Gethin Pryce, mayor of Dunmere, for my sins. The ore's gone bad — comes up grey and brittle and the smiths won't touch it, and my crews won't go below the second level, and I don't blame them.

**q3_tollan_ask**

- `q3_tollan_ask_1` — [hopeful] So. Will you go down, and what will it cost me? Say it plain; I've no head for haggling today.

**q3_tollan_crews**

- `q3_tollan_crews_1` — [low] Lights, on the fourth level, where there's no lamps. Chanting. And a man — the last crew that came up swore it was a man, big, in a robe, standing by something like an altar. They didn't stay to ask him his business, and I don't blame them for that either.

**q3_tollan_fee**

- `q3_tollan_fee_1` — [wincing] Two hundred. There's lovely. — Fine. Fine! Half now and half when you come up, and if you come up with clean ore I'll carry you round the square myself.

**q3_tollan_iron**

- `q3_tollan_iron_1` — [bitter] Whoever's selling good iron while mine's bad. There's one house doing that on this coast, and it's the Consortium, and I've said so to the magistrate twice and got a shrug both times.

**q3_tollan_selene_reply**

- `q3_tollan_selene_reply_1` — [bitter] Same hand, bach, and you know it or you wouldn't ask. The Iron Consortium out of the Gate takes every wagon — they've the roads. They've been very sorry about the bad ore. Very sorry, and very quick to sell the smiths their own stock instead, at a price.

**q3_tollan_winston_reply**

- `q3_tollan_winston_reply_1` — [bitter] One. The Iron Consortium out of the Gate. They've the roads, so they've the ore, and they've been very sorry about it being bad, and very quick to sell the smiths good iron of their own instead.

**q3_tollan_yes**

- `q3_tollan_yes_1` — [nearly weeping] Bless you. Bless you, I mean it. It won't be much, but it'll be everything we've got, and the whole town will know your name.

**q4_thanks**

- `q4_thanks_1` — [overjoyed] The crews went down at dawn and came up with clean ore. Clean! I haven't heard a bar ring true on that anvil since winter. Duw, I could sing.
- `q4_thanks_2` — [earnest] Dunmere owes you more than it can pay, bach. Here's what it can. And — if you go north after the people who did this, the town would take it kindly if you didn't come back alone.

## Nib  `nib`

**Sex:** male · **Role:** knife · **Voice ID:** aiHuPZx6mGgpzcNDwtX2

**Who they are:** The first hired knife, a Shore Road man in a road-cloak with a purse to earn. Easy-going about murder; not paid enough to be brave.

**From:** Thornbury, the Shore Road and the Wardens' country — Georgia, USA. **Voice:** Warm drawl. "I reckon", "I'll tell you what", "y'all", "fixing to", "bless him". Plain-spoken courtesy; ma'am and sir to strangers. Long vowels, short tempers.

**q1_nib_draw**

- `q1_nib_draw_1` — [flat] Reckon I have.

**q1_nib_richer**

- `q1_nib_richer_1` — [amused] For somebody who don't want to be spoken of. Two hundred in gold for the ward of Tesfaye of Lanternhold, alive or otherwise. That's a heap of money for a scholar's foundling, and I'll be honest, I did wonder why.

**q1_nib_run**

- `q1_nib_run_1` — [backing away]...You're either real kind or real foolish, and I ain't paid enough to find out which.

**q1_nib_who**

- `q1_nib_who_1` — [a shrug] There's never a name, friend. A seal on a letter, a purse left at an inn, a description of a face. That's how it's done, and it's done that way so men like me can't answer questions like yours.

**q1_store**

- `q1_store_1` — [easy] Evening. You'd be the old man's ward, then. Younger than I was told, and about to make somebody a good deal richer.
- `q1_store_2` — [almost kindly] No call to make this hard. I've a purse to earn and a road to be on before sun-up, and you've got — what, a practice sword? Stand still and I'll make it quick.

## Sanni  `sarn`

**Sex:** male · **Role:** stranger · **Voice ID:** pL61gpUJHGbG1ctjcpcm

**Who they are:** A quiet stranger with a ring to give away. The disguise Kolade wears when he wants to watch you choose.

**From:** Varenholm's Gate — dukes, Gauntlet, Consortium, temples, thieves — Nigerian (Yoruba and Igbo). **Voice:** Grand, formal city English. "It is not a small matter", "my friend", "ah-ah!", "I am telling you", "o" softening the end of a line. Titles matter; elders are "Baba" and "Mama".

**q10_ring**

- `q10_ring_1` — [quiet, city-formal] You are Tesfaye's ward. I knew him. Not well; well enough to be sorry.
- `q10_ring_2` — [calm] Take this ring. It was his once, before it was mine. And know this, my friend: the three men inside deserve whatever you decide to give them. Nobody will weep.

**q10_ring_ask**

- `q10_ring_ask_1` — [pleasantly] Take it or do not, my friend; I have a long walk either way.

**q10_ring_hiwot_end**

- `q10_ring_hiwot_end_1` — [pleasantly] No. It is not. — The ring. Take it or do not; I have a long walk either way.

**q10_ring_hiwot_reply**

- `q10_ring_hiwot_reply_1` — [a warm, easy smile] The way one knows a rumour, young lady. From a distance, and better than the rumour would like.

**q10_sarn_refuse**

- `q10_sarn_refuse_1` — [amused] Wise. Tesfaye taught you that. Go well anyway.

**q10_sarn_take**

- `q10_sarn_take_1` — [soft] Sanni. Nobody. Wear it inside; the keepers will know it. Go well.

**q10_sarn_threat**

- `q10_sarn_threat_1` — [pleased] I believe you would. Go well.

## Tesfaye  `aldric`

**Sex:** male · **Role:** recruiter · **Voice ID:** EFtnObJs7ex53VSB3niw

**Who they are:** Your foster-father, a retired Warden mage who keeps the library at Lanternhold. Gentle voice, iron patience, a man who has planned for this night for twenty years.

**From:** Lanternhold and the hill keeps — Ethiopian highlands. **Voice:** Formal, unhurried, proverb-rich. Blessings and "my child". Sentences finish; nothing is clipped. Anger comes out quieter, not louder.

**q1_answer**

- `q1_answer_1` — [level] It knows what I taught it. Letters, kindness, and how to hold a blade. That is all the knowing it needs, and more than you were ever given.
- `q1_answer_2` — [to the ward, fierce and low] Run. Do not look back, whatever you hear. Find the Open Hand Inn on the Shore Road. Ask for Beau and Delphine. Run!

**q1_cobb**

- `q1_cobb_1` — [hard] Two of them, inside the keep, on the same night. Somebody bought a keeper's silence for that, and I mean to know whose. Later.
- `q1_cobb_2` — [urgent] The one in the storehouse. Did he say anything before it ended? Who sent him — a name, a house, a mark?

**q1_cobb_bounty**

- `q1_cobb_bounty_1` — [quiet] Two hundred. That is not a grudge; that is a budget. Somebody with money has decided you are worth it, and I would give a great deal to know how they came to that sum. Finish this one; we go the moment the gate opens.

**q1_cobb_nothing**

- `q1_cobb_nothing_1` — [gently] No. There would not have been. It is a thing you learn: ask first, strike after, when you can. Finish this one; we go the moment the gate opens.

**q1_cobb_seal**

- `q1_cobb_seal_1` — [grim] A seal. Then it is a house that wants you, not a man, and houses keep ledgers and ledgers keep names. That is the first useful thing anyone has told me in twenty years. Finish this one; we go the moment the gate opens.

**q1_cobb_spared**

- `q1_cobb_spared_1` — [thoughtful] He went. That was kinder than I would have been in your place. Remember that it cost us nothing tonight; it will not always.
- `q1_cobb_spared_2` — [urgent] And here is a second one, in the brothers' quarters. Before you finish him — the first one. Did he say who sent him? A name, a house, a mark?

**q1_death**

- `q1_death_1` — [struck through] Go —

**q1_refuse**

- `q1_refuse_1` — [steady] You know my name; I do not know yours, and I find I do not care to. You will not have this child while I stand. Take that as my answer.

**q1_road**

- `q1_road_1` — [quiet] Stay close, and keep to the shadow of the trees. This road is empty at night, and I have learned to dislike empty roads.
- `q1_road_2` — [after a silence] In case I do not find a better moment — I have been proud of you every day since I carried you through that gate. Whatever you hear about yourself in the days to come, hold to that. A tree with deep roots laughs at the wind.
- `q1_road_3` — [sharp] Torches. Ahead, and closing. Off the road — now.

**q1_seen_nobody**

- `q1_seen_nobody_1` — [relieved] Then they are not inside the walls yet, and we have the hours I hoped for. Take what coin you have to Dawit at the storehouse and buy a true blade; the practice swords stay behind. Meet me at the gate at the second bell, and if anyone stops you between here and there — anyone — do not argue with them. Come to me.

**q1_seen_pilgrim**

- `q1_seen_pilgrim_1` — [very quiet] You told him. — No. It is not your fault; you had no reason not to. It means they are inside already, and it means we go now, not at the bell. Take your coin to Dawit at the storehouse and buy a true blade, and come straight back to me. Do not stop for anyone.

**q1_seen_why**

- `q1_seen_why_1` — [gently] Because the people I have feared for twenty years have found the one place I hoped they never would. That is the whole answer, and I will give you the rest on the road. Take your coin to Dawit at the storehouse and buy a true blade. Then the gate, at the second bell.

**q1_wake**

- `q1_wake_1` — [low, urgent] Wake, my child, and dress. Not the library robe — the travelling coat, and your boots. We leave Lanternhold tonight.
- `q1_wake_2` — [calm] I know you have questions. I have dreaded them for twenty years, and I will answer every one once we are past the gate and out of the hearing of these walls. Not before. Trust me in this as you have trusted me in everything.

**q1_wake_afraid**

- `q1_wake_afraid_1` — [a breath] Yes. I am afraid. I have never lied to you and I will not begin tonight. Fear is not shameful, my child; it is a messenger. Mine says to have you on the road before the moon is up.

**q1_wake_ask**

- `q1_wake_ask_1` — [careful] One thing before you go, and answer it truly. Has anyone spoken to you today whom you did not know? A pilgrim, a pedlar, a man asking directions. Anyone.

**q1_wake_go**

- `q1_wake_go_1` — [warm] Good.

**q1_wake_why**

- `q1_wake_why_1` — [quietly] A message came at dusk, of the kind that is not written down. It said that people who wish you harm know where you are. Lanternhold, which I chose because nothing here changes and no one ever comes, has stopped being safe. That is all I will say inside these walls.

**q4_dream**

- `q4_dream_1` — [echoing] You are dreaming, my child, and I am dead, and both of those things are true at once.
- `q4_dream_2` — [gentle] There is a throne in this dream. You will see it more clearly each time you come here. Do not sit in it. Do not look at it for long.
- `q4_dream_3` — [fading] Something in your blood is waking. You can feed it or you can starve it. That is the only choice that matters, and you will make it more than once.

**q4_dream_ask**

- `q4_dream_ask_1` — [sorrowful] If I could, I would. Dreams are not letters; they carry only what you already half-know. You are the child of something that should have stayed dead — and you are mine. Both. Only the second is yours to keep.

**q4_dream_embrace**

- `q4_dream_embrace_1` — [grieving] I cannot stop you here; only you can. You will wake with a gift for opening wounds. Mind what it makes you want.

**q4_dream_reject**

- `q4_dream_reject_1` — [warm] Good. That is the harder road, and the right one. You will wake with a gift for closing wounds. Spend it on other people.

**q7_dream**

- `q7_dream_1` — [echoing] Closer to the throne this time, my child. You did not walk here. It walked to you.
- `q7_dream_2` — [grave] There are others like you. More than you would believe. All of them dreaming of the same chair.
- `q7_dream_3` — [fading] You can still refuse it, my child. It will offer you more power each time. Remember what taking it would cost.

**q7_dream_embrace**

- `q7_dream_embrace_1` — [grieving] The strongest of them is waiting for you at the end of this road, and he thinks exactly that.
- `q7_dream_embrace_2` — [fading] Please, my child. Be careful what you become on the way to him.

**q7_dream_others**

- `q7_dream_others_1` — [quiet] I never learned the number. Enough that the one who hunts you has made a study of it, and is not afraid of running out.

**q7_dream_reject**

- `q7_dream_reject_1` — [proud] Twice now. It grows harder each time and you keep saying no. That is what courage is. No one warns you that it is dull.

**q10_double**

- `q10_double_1` — [Tesfaye's voice, wrong] I am not dead. It was a trick — a Warden trick — come to me, child, come here —

**q10_dream**

- `q10_dream_1` — [echoing] You know now. I am sorry it was a letter.
- `q10_dream_2` — [grave] He is your brother, and he will be a god if enough people die at once. That is the whole of his plan. It is not a stupid plan.
- `q10_dream_3` — [fading] The last time I ask. Feed it, or starve it.

**q10_dream_embrace**

- `q10_dream_embrace_1` — [quiet] Then I hope I am wrong about what that costs. I have been wrong before. Not about this. Go.

**q10_dream_reject**

- `q10_dream_reject_1` — [at peace] Then I did enough. Go and finish it, my child, and come home to whoever is waiting.

**q10_letter**

- `q10_letter_1` — [echoing, read aloud] "If you are reading this, my child, I failed to tell you myself, and I am sorry. Your mother was one of many. Your father was Morrak, the god of murder, in the last year before he died — and he sired children so that one of them might one day take his place. You are one. So is the man who killed me. He is your brother. He believes the throne is his. It is not, unless you decide it is."

- `q11_way_2` — [softer] Fair. Here is what nobody told you, my friend: under the palace is the old city. Under the old city is a temple. He is going there when it falls apart. So are you.

**q12_council_dead**

- `q12_council_dead_1` — [soft] Two dead dukes and a hall full of witnesses. The Undervault will take you down; the Gauntlet is too busy counting bodies.

**From:** Lanternhold and the hill keeps — Ethiopian highlands. **Voice:** Formal, unhurried, proverb-rich. Blessings and "my child". Sentences finish; nothing is clipped. Anger comes out quieter, not louder.

**q5_sage**

- `q5_sage_1` — [amused] You have looked at me three times this week, my child, and decided each time that I was nobody. That is a good instinct. It is wrong this once.
- `q5_sage_2` — [calm] I am called Yohannes. Tesfaye was my friend before this town had a wall, and I have watched his ward from a distance because that is what he asked of me, and because I am a coward about goodbyes.
- `q5_sage_3` — [quiet, exact] Now. Before I tell you anything, tell me something. The man in black on the Griffon Road. What did he say to Tesfaye? Word for word, if you can.

**q5_sage_ask**

- `q5_sage_ask_1` — [dry] Well? I can see you are not satisfied. Tell me what you want to know.

**q5_test_forget**

- `q5_test_forget_1` — [gently] Then you did as you were told, and you are alive to be asked, and that is the whole of what Tesfaye wanted from that night. Ask me what you like. I will answer what I can.

**q5_test_refuse**

- `q5_test_refuse_1` — [chuckling] Tesfaye said you would be like this. He said it fondly, mostly. — Ask me what you like, before you go and do it.

**q5_test_word**

- `q5_test_word_1` — [very still] "Your library." He knew about the library. Then he has known where you were for years, and waited, and chose his night. That is worse than I feared and better than I guessed: a patient man can be found. — Ask me what you like. I will answer what I can.

**q5_torvald_armour**

- `q5_torvald_armour_1` — [carefully] I have not seen his face. I have seen his work. He does not want you dead for anything you have done; he wants you dead for what you are, and he is not the only one who will. That is as much as I will say before you have earned the rest.

**q5_torvald_go**

- `q5_torvald_go_1` — [calm] The inn, for the courier. The Gnashing Wood, for the rest. Go well, child, since you will go anyway.

**q5_torvald_help**

- `q5_torvald_help_1` — [dry] I have helped. Twice. You did not see either time, which is what help from me looks like.
- `q5_torvald_help_2` — [warm] The courier you want keeps a room at the inn here; the bandits are north, in the Gnashing Wood. Bring the letters out alive. That is the help I need from you.

**q5_torvald_why**

- `q5_torvald_why_1` — [gently] He died so that you would live long enough to be told properly, by the right person, in the right place. That place is not a stable yard in Thornbury, and I am not the right person; I am only the one who knew him longest.
- `q5_torvald_why_2` — [calm] Go north. Find the letters. Paper will bring you to the truth faster than I would, and you will believe paper where you would not believe me.

- `q10_summit_2` — [shaking] Adigun Adeyinka. I run the Consortium's Gate office. I did not order Tesfaye killed. I did not order YOU killed. That was — ah-ah, that was my son. My foster-son. He does not answer to me anymore.

**q10_summit_arrest**

- `q10_summit_arrest_1` — [relieved] Yes. Yes. Adebayo. Anything. Take us out of here before he —

**q10_summit_selene_reply**

- `q10_summit_selene_reply_1` — [miserable] Mine. The house's. — He took it off my desk in the spring, and my couriers with it, and I have been signing for a man who no longer asks me.

**q10_summit_talk**

- `q10_summit_talk_1` — [whispering] Kolade. Kolade Adeyinka. I found him in a gutter and I raised him to count money, and he has been counting something else since a tutor filled his head with prophecies.

**q5_verlan_pay**

- `q5_verlan_pay_1` — [greedy, low] Fifty. Yes. There is a map in my boot: past Holloway Vale, under the old oak line. Do not use the road; they watch the road.
